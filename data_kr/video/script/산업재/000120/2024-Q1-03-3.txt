Word by word,
staffers carefully write their messages
 on the puzzle pieces.
"bibigo, beyond global to cosmic!"
"Go, new and improved bibigo!"
The heartfelt messages of encouragement
are eye-catching.
Embodying the staff's hope
that the younger and brighter new bibigo
will grow bigger globally,
the giant logo is completed.
Marking the launch of the new brand logo,
today's special event was organized
to thank the staff, who have been
part of bibigo's story of growth.
Staffers who submitted well wishes 
for bibigo's success
were eligible to receive a special gift.
Odds of winning? 100%.
Cute company merchandise
emblazoned with the new bibigo BI
was very popular.
Staffers also got their sugar fix
from sweet cookies, drinks, and tasty snacks.
And they got four-cut pictures taken
with their colleagues in a photo booth
to celebrate and commemorate
bibigo's renewal.

We're more pumped for the day thanks to
a special lunchtime treat of pics and snacks.
The staff had a wonderful time
at bibigo's special in-house event.
We hope that the new and improved bibigo
will make life more delicious and fun
for people around the world.
