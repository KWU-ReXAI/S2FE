A row of apparel is automatically packaged
as it moves along the conveyor belt.
It's APPS,
the Apparel Automatic Packaging System
developed specifically for
apparel polybag packaging
by the CJ Logistics Packaging Innovation Center.
This was designed not only
to cut logistics costs through automation
but also to use recycled plastic packaging
and minimize the inconvenience
of sorting recyclables.
Another tech breakthrough
by the Packaging Innovation Center is
the tapeless box packing solution,
consisting of a one-touch box
and tape-type shipping label.
These two technologies have been
successfully commercialized recently
with their rollout for customer merchandise.
The Packaging Innovation Center,
which opened in April 2023,
houses a packaging safety lab,
logistics environment testing lab,
and automated equipment verification lab,
where R&D on cutting-edge
packaging technologies is underway.
A load of up to 5,000 kg is applied
to measure the compressive strength
a parcel box can withstand,
or a parcel box is dropped
from up to a height of 1.2 m
to identify the areas of damage
and vulnerability.
In short, diverse tests are conducted
with the aim of developing
the safest and most cost-effective packaging.
Using the data thus collected,
the Packaging Innovation Center
recently developed
'merchandise-stationary packaging'
by installing supports in a box
to keep the merchandise suspended
and away from the inside faces of the box.
Planned for commercialization
within this year,
this technology is expected
to reduce the risk of merchandise damage
and cut costs by providing
optimized boxes.
With the Packaging Innovation Center
playing a leading role,
CJ Logistics will continue
to seek logistics innovation
and be the future leader
of the home parcel delivery market.
