On May 3, CJ CheilJedang signed
a business agreement with T'Way Air
for the joint development of in-flight meals
for the airline's European routes.
Through this agreement,
CJ CheilJedang will roll out
two breakfast options for
T'Way's Incheon-Zagreb flights
and develop various in-flight menus.
T'Way Air's expansion to Europe is expected
to attract budget-conscious travelers
who wish to visit Europe.
In turn, CJ CheilJedang B2B Biz HQ
will jointly develop and provide in-flight meals
that will boost passenger satisfaction
and promote the high quality
of CJ CheilJedang products.
Since 2018, CJ CheilJedang has been pursuing
a domestic airline catering business.
The company has developed customized meals
for client firms
and hosted tastings to seek new opportunities.
Through steadfast research and investment,
in 2023, CJ CheilJedang developed
Korea's first frozen in-flight meals
that ensure a reliable, high-quality
airline catering service.
Then starting with Korean Air
followed by Aero K Airlines
and Jeju Air, CJ CheilJedang continued
to expand the customized menu portfolio
for each client airline.
CJ CheilJedang now services flights
to more than 40 cities
in around 20 nations across the globe.
The two in-flight meal options
jointly developed with T'Way
are packaged in eco-friendly paper trays
to make airline catering more sustainable.
We plan to use the airline catering platform
as a springboard to pioneer
new B2B ecosystems and markets.
We will transform the B2B markets
of airline catering, cafeteria catering,
and food service
so that elaborate cooking
in central kitchens are replaced
by convenient one-meal tray food solutions.
