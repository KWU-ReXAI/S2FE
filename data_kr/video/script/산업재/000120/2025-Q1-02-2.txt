On the 15th, the CJ Olive Young
Gyeongsan Logistics Center,
located in Jinryang-eup,
Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongbuk,
held its opening ceremony
and officially began operations.
Covering a total area of 38,000㎡,
equivalent to six soccer fields,
the center will handle logistics for
the non-metropolitan regions,
including Yeongnam, Chungcheong, and Honam,
due to its strategic geographical location.
With this,
the logistics volume destined for over
1,300 Olive Young stores nationwide
can now be split between
the Yangji Logistics Center,
which handles the Seoul metropolitan area,
and the new facility, establishing
a nationwide logistics network.
This foundation is expected to enhance
not only store operations
but also ensure a more stable
same-day delivery service,
"Oneul Deuriem."
The Gyeongsan Logistics Center
serves as a key logistics hub
for non-metropolitan areas,
including Jeju,
overseeing inventory reception,
storage, shipping, and transportation
for over 500 stores
outside the capital region.
This establishes a foundation
for a more precise
and responsive supply chain
tailored to regional demand.
The Gyeongsan Logistics Center 
has automated 90% of its logistics processes,
enabling a daily shipment capacity
of up to one million units.
It is equipped with systems that enhance
logistics productivity and efficiency,
including robots that transport
incoming and outgoing goods to workers,
handle heavy box-unit items,
and an automated sorting system
that classifies individual products
based on their delivery destinations.
Thanks to these advancements,
the Gyeongsan Logistics Center became
the first in the industry
to receive the highest rating in
the Smart Logistics Center
Certification evaluation
by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport.
To eliminate inefficiencies
such as manual box cutting,
the center has implemented
robotic cutting machines,
significantly improving
worker productivity.
The "Soft Suit" system is applied
after product sorting,
ensuring items
land gently when dropped.
Since it is designed
primarily for small items,
it has significantly
reduced product damage.
In August last year, CJ Olive Young
opened the Anseong Logistics Center,
dedicated to global mall operations
and private brand logistics.
At the same time, 
it has been expanding
its urban logistics centers,
originally concentrated
in the Seoul metropolitan area,
to major metropolitan cities
and smaller regional towns nationwide,
strengthening
its logistics infrastructure.
Moving forward,
the company plans to continue investing
to enhance its competitiveness
in the K-beauty industry
while fostering mutual growth
with partner brands and suppliers.
