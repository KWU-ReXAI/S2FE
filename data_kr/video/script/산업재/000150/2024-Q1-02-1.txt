good afternoon everyone thank you for
joining us today my name is Jeff Chung
I'm the president and CEO of hay aium a
Ducan group
company before introducing hay aium and
sharing our clean hydrogen Solutions I'd
like to First focus on the why why are
we focused on the hydrogen business it's
actually a straightforward
question most experts agree that
hydrogen can help reduce the world's
carbon
dependency hydrogen has emerged as the
Next Generation source of energy that
can help lead and accelerate this
unprecedented
transition that's obviously a Monumental
challenge but thanks to extensive
R&D and remarkable
Innovations the production and
application of hydrogen at a full large
scale is now technically feasible and
commercially cost effective with
hydrogen we don't need to burn coal or
natural gas which produce CO2 and
intensifies the negative impacts of
climate change instead with hydrogen
fuel we emit zero carbon dioxide zero
nitrogen oxide zero sulfur oxide or
other harmful
substances the only byproduct from
hydrogen
water
for a cleaner future hydrogen hydrogen
can certainly be the focal point we
envisioned many applications such as
fuel for automobiles and Maritime
vessels electricity and heat generation
and feed stock for hard to Abate
manufacturing Industries such as oil
ammonia methanol and
steel in addition hydrogen provides an
ideal ideal and viable method to store
transport and deliver energy produced
from other intermittent renewable energy
sources such as solar and
wind this enhances the flexibility of
our Energy
System ducan's hydrogen business is
focused on the most promising areas
within the hydrogen value chain our
business mix ranges from Green hydrogen
production to applying hydrogen for
power generation and
transportation we believe ducon is best
position to make impactful changes in
these areas that will fundamentally
improve our world our world leading
electrolyzers and Fuel Cell Technologies
can help us deliver a full spectrum of
reliable and cost effective hydrogen
solutions to achieve a carbon-free
future and enhance energy
security that's a solid
transformation
