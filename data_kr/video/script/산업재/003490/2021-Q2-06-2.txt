Today is my last day of work before I go on leave
I miss when the planes were packed and heavy
I really miss my colleagues
I have no idea when my next flight will be
The empty and quiet terminal
How are our colleagues doing?
I last worked in October last year, so it's been about six months.
I am really happy to work. I didn’t know I would be so happy. 
I am saddened when I see all the parked planes that should be in the air. 
It’s not easy always being alone when staying overseas.
I’m sad when I see the empty terminal
and planes parked on the apron.
I miss the airport bustling with people. It’s too quiet now.
I really miss you. 
Are you well? [japanese]
Are you okay? [japanese]
It has to be fun, fun and fun.
If not, nobody will watch it.
Thank you for watching. 
I hope Daehan TV can become a channel that helps improve communication between employees.
I hope the channel will be original and different.
It would be great to get some helpful tips for work. 
Make it fun to watch with parodies. 
If I make a request to see someone on the channel, will you have them appear?
We will try.
I want to see everyone. 
I don't want to be the only one interviewing
I want to see BTS, if possible.
"We can't help for that"
I want to see our President! Is that too much? 
Will it be possible to see our President?
May I help you?
This is Daehan TV
Oh, Welcome!

I hope Daehan TV will serve as an effective communications channel for 
increased communications between the company and employees

I look forward to seeing you all soon.
Thank You.
