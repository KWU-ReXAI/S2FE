Royer thank you for joining us sir thank
you
excellent nice polish
um snc makes many products what have you
brought to show us and what would you
like to show us and our viewers at
defense 34pl the first product uh you
would like to present here is a power
pack Korean power pack 1500 horsepower
Korean power pack for main battle tank
as you see here
pulping means the combination of the
transmissions and engine
and for about the Korean transmission
and it has it has some different uh
different some highest points for other
than any other than Transmission in the
world it has a shift six for the
shifting and three backwards shifting
function
I have have my own car and in I drive my
car in a highway I would not I would not
some low level shift it has and it
provides can give the some further
arrange for the miles and buy the same
some fuel uh to foreign operation
extending some operation options to any
military forces especially Poland
military forces as well
speaking of military forces this power
pack is already in use in a certain uh
country already it's being tested
operationally uh what can you tell us
about that uh you know that this Korean
Power Platform main battle tank
experience and a completed very harsh
very harsh test last year in certain
European countries and then the military
force and the country was decided to use
this power pack it is Korean power pack
and eventually we made some contract for
the serial program and we are now
preparing the supply of this power pack
to the their country
speaking of proven Solutions you have
another transmission over here that is
already being used in Poland and is well
known in our country what can you tell
us about that oh right we are we are the
I think the PowerHouse of the technology
in a military area we saw we provide a
solution for the power drive and we
provide solution for the firearms and
kennels especially for first this
transmission and then we have another
transmission we have here uh can you
move to there
So speaking of proven reliable Solutions
we have one here that is already being
used in Poland and in other countries
what can you tell us about this
uh this transmission is for hoicher and
now it is for the crop it is for the
canine it is for the also the K10 K10 is
a ammo supply vehicle and recently it
also is decided for use of the Infantry
Fighting Vehicle we call the red bag
and we have produced more than 2500
units so far and then I think the I
don't need to tell more about that this
is a very reliable proven uh
transmission and this transmission the
sister the transmission of this is used
now Abram and many other many other some
Vehicles it is already proven uh it is
one of the sister variation of the 1100
transmission and and it will be best uh
if we cooperate further uh by this
Transmission in Poland
in addition to Transmissions snc also
makes various weapon systems including
one that you are proposing to Poland and
that you've shown in full scale and also
as a model can you show us one of the
examples yes I will
can you tell us more about this weapon
system yeah sure this is a 120
millimeter motor a self-propelled motor
in Korean side this motor is a newly
developed and is now using at the middle
ground military forces side as a tractor
vehicle type we call the k200 we have
k200 vehicles and then the bit companies
and modified some hatch part and this
motor is mounted on that now that we
finish it all the test evaluation phase
and now the field it in the actual
Battlefield in Korea and this is a wheel
platform based mortar maybe this wheel
based motor can provide some further
further range of mobility and to further
some other any other purpose of this
maneuver which can can be some good
option to the military force and in
Poland as well so we brought this for
the presentation here okay so this is a
a an automatic loading system can you
tell us how it works to say more about
the function of this motor
once the this motor can get a targeting
information it can make a first shot
within 30 seconds
and then this firing range of this motor
is 13
kilometers from the spot of the boiling
and
it can be loaded and shotted 10 rounds
per minute
so this can be mounted on most if not
all 4x4 tactical Vehicles like this one
yeah this motor was developed as a
modularization based so the it can be
mounted on there's some rear part of the
any vehicle
okay so this is a Kia KLTV with the 120
millimeter mortar mounted in the back
what can you tell us about this
particular vehicle yeah as you see this
is a tactical vehicle which is
130 millimeter motor here it is we are
now the cooperating with this gear and
then we just want to support by this
motor for use in this type of the field
vehicle give given that Poland is now
going to be manufacturing these do you
think it would be likely that the Polish
military could be interested in a system
like this yeah yeah we are open open for
any Corporation open for any support in
Poland
in addition to heavy weapon systems like
this you've also brought along a smaller
lighter system that goes high up in the
air can you show us to us oh sure there
thank you
so one other weapon system that you've
brought along on the display is a three
barrel 20 millimeter Gatling gun what
can you tell us about this weapon system
yeah as you as you say the this is a 20
millimeter three better threaded gun
system we developed this 30 degree
system for the Light Armored helicopters
most important thing in this turreted
the ground system is it has even more
and better function and capability than
any other targeted gun system but we
make this 30 skin guns weight is a half
the half then the system and other
systems and then the although it also
can be used for other purpose like rcws
rcws is a remote weapon system remote
control weapon system and we already
made some prototype for the remote
weapon control weapon system type and it
can give some bad big solution to the
many areas
in addition to all the weapon systems
that we've seen on your stand SNT is
also famous for making Auto cannons is
there a chance that in the future you
could bring along some of those like the
40 millimeter ones the 20 millimeter one
sure uh we have some uh 15 from the 15
caliber 20 millimeter gun for fighter
and 20 millimeter Gatling and six very
guttling and this is the three bear
Catalin and we also have a 30 millimeter
Auto Cannon this is for anti-aircraft
now the we are now doing the some uh
seven better seven better 30 millimeter
as well and 40 millimeter we have
solution for the battleship we have
solution for the Fighting Vehicle we so
also have some solution for the some aav
is for marine
especially for the 40 millimeter for
marine vehicle we already developed for
that and this this system is far more
compact far more compact than the
previous and existing and 40 millimeter
gun system so it will be very good
solution if there is some people who
think about this some lighter and better
function Canon system 40 millimeter
candle system excellent thank you for
joining us at defense 24pl Hope you join
us at mspa 2024 and we will see you soon
in the next episode take care yeah thank
