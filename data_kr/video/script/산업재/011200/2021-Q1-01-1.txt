okay let's go ahead and say it
if those protesters had have been
predominantly black
it would be way more people dead than
the one lone woman shot by capitol
police
i mean you had [ __ ] sitting in
offices and [ __ ] getting their picture
took
what the [ __ ] trump gang was fully
active in them streets on god
i guess we have a few white folks
getting tired of being treated like
blacks
had them poor congress folk praying all
scared and [ __ ]
i bet they ask past them two thousand
dollar checks next time
sitting around playing and fussing like
an old couple giving all the damn candy
to the neighbors while giving their own
[ __ ] grandkids one
thunky ass peace but what do you think
was at the core that made protesters
rush the capitol building
