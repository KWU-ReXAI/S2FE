hey what's going on youtube kenny here
so intel's up almost nine percent in the
market open um
right now it's at eight percent but it
was definitely up there for a while
and amd uh down about four and a half
percent right now so it's definitely
bleeding off a little bit same old story
once intel goes up
amd goes down there's only one pod of
money for
semiconductors apparently but at least
we don't have that one for one special
like we did before it's about one to two
ratio at this point but
if you're wondering what intel did
that's so awesome or what amd did that's
so catastrophic well
i think this is actually kind of
hilarious if you ask me but uh
basically cnbc reported that bob swan is
uh stepping down so the previous intel
ceo and ceo pat gelsinger is taking his
place um
atop the tech giant so intel shares
jumped more than 9.6 percent actually to
58.41 after cnbc broke the story ahead
of the stock market open
uh gelsinger 59 years old has been in
the tech industry for more than 40 years
and has served as ceo as vmware since
2012 doubling the size of the company
during the tenure uh
it just goes on to talk about more of
that stuff but the the thing that i'd
say
if you're asking me and you know uh we
only shill amd on this so you're never
gonna hear me say anything that great
about intel because they just blew the
lead i mean
if you have all that money all that
talent all that technology
you are so far ahead you blow the lead
like that to a much much smaller company
i don't give you a lot of credit or
respect um
and intel bulls go ahead and thumbs down
this this is fine but
uh you lost your ceo and your stock goes
up
think about think about that
you lose your ceo your stock goes up
i guess this is a turnaround story um
but
old uh gelsinger here needs to prove
himself for sure
uh good old pat is gonna have to prove
himself and so i don't know why you give
the stock 10 for having a brand new guy
that hasn't proved himself yet so
super interesting but i guess the point
is that it's so bad that
it can only go one way from here uh but
that's not how
it works so i mean if you add you know
more bad fuel to a bad rocket that's not
going the right way
can do have the opposite effect for sure
but anyway those are just my thoughts
real quick just want to post a quick
video in case you're
interested in why this happened and uh
yeah thanks for watching i'll make
another video today i'm sure so i'll see
you again
thanks bye
