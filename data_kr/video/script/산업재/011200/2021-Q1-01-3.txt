- I just wanna address one thing today.
I hear about,
I hear this statement a lot.
My parents went through
probate, it wasn't that bad.
And I hear that a lot.
My name is Phillip Ruce.
I'm an estate planning
attorney here in Minnesota.
And I hear this statement a lot
when we talk about probate
skipping strategies
when it comes to estate
planning and asset protection.
How do we avoid probate?
We oftentimes use this thing
called a revocable trust.
There's other ways.
And sometimes folks will
say, you don't need that.
Probate's not that bad.
And I agree that in Minnesota,
we don't have the nightmare probate system
that we have in some other states.
If you go to New York,
California, Florida,
it can cost $50,000 to
get through probate.
Minnesota is not like that.
I always tell folks to prepare
for something less than $10,000.
We're always hoping it's closer to 5,000.
Sometimes you get an extremely
straightforward probate
that's less than that, I
would not count on that.
But the statement itself,
probate is not that bad,
that implies to me that it was bad.
It just wasn't that bad.
I've never once heard somebody
at a family go through probate
and say, wow, that was fantastic.
Let's do that again.
No one likes it.
Universally, nobody likes probate.
It's always at the minimum,
a big pain in the butt.
If it's not that bad, you're
just saying that it's bad.
It just wasn't that bad, I don't know.
It always strikes me as
kind of a funny phrase.
But again, if you don't
care about probate,
if you really don't care about it,
there's nothing saying
you have to skip it.
But what you do wanna do
is you wanna make sure
you're at least controlling it.
So if you're not gonna try
to avoid this court process,
probate again, it's the
administrative court proceeding
where if I die, my stuff gets divided up.
We gotta have someone who's
empowered to sell the house.
We have to have someone who
can get my bank accounts,
pay my medical bills.
If we go to probate and
you have no documents,
we use Minnesota's backup rules.
They're called the intestacy
statutes, excuse me.
Hard to say that intestacy statutes.
The intestacy statutes are
the government plan for you.
There's already a plan
set up by the legislature.
We don't want that plan.
We want your plan.
So at the minimum, you must
do a will to guide the court
through the probate process.
A will is a court document
that controls probate,
it overwrites those default
rules with your rules.
And that's what we want.
So at the minimum,
if we are okay with the
expense, time and publicity,
the public nature of probate,
you still wanna make
sure you're doing a will.
Make sure it's valid.
Make sure it has all
the probate rules in it.
You don't want a one page will.
That's usually not a good time.
It has to have your backups.
If this person can't administer
the estate, this person can.
If something happens to this person,
this is who gets the money.
Instead, you wanna have all
that stuff built in there
and make sure that it is a thorough,
legal and administratively
workable will document
at the minimum.
If you're looking to avoid it,
there are strategies for that as well.
Any questions, please do give me an email.
