we are in some version
of the logical conclusion of our
financial system as we've known it from
my entire life
what happens next now there's no real
answer to that part of the question we
can just speculate
gather as many perspectives and ideas as
possible and then draw our
own conclusion
[Music]
this sunday february 7th we're going to
be focusing just on that
where is the life raft and where is the
upside in 2021
now we just wrapped up hosting the
vancouver resource investment conference
right here on the youtube channel it
consisted of about
70 one-on-one interviews with industry
personalities and company ceos
everybody from small camp money managers
up to the 22nd prime minister of canada
stephen harper it was a total blast to
produce that event so thank you for
everybody
who came out now one of the benefits of
hosting so many conversations in such a
short amount of time
is that you can't help but pick up on
where there is consensus
and where there is still room for debate
this sunday february 7th i'll be joined
by danielle dimartino booth
the ceo and chief strategist for quill
intelligence and the author of
fed up an insider's take on why the
federal reserve is bad for
america i'll also be joined by grant
williams the author of things that make
you go hmm
one of the most widely read financial
publications in the world and grant also
hosts the grant williams podcast
again one of the most listened to
podcasts in the business
then from the vancouver resource
investment conference i'm bringing a few
people back we're going to bring back
raul powell co-founder of real vision
television
and the author of global macro investor
we're bringing back peter schiff euro
pacific capital
and brent johnson of santiago capital
i'll also be joined by one
and maybe two investment opportunities
that we can grill along the way
so this sunday february 7th where is the
life raft

channel i hope to see you there
