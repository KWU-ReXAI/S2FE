hey guys meteorologist doug hetty want
to give you an update on what we're
going to see as we go through the next
couple days of course we had showers
thunderstorms
last night most of our northern counties
got it and then our southern counties
got it not a whole bunch through the
center heart of the four state region of
course youtube videos make sure you like
subscribe and then once you subscribe
you can hit that little bell in the top
right corner and you'll get
notifications
of these videos coming down all right
look at the rain that we saw through the
evening hours even mixed in with some
sleet at times kind of spitting out
there it's quite a bit cooler
than what it was
especially over the past day or two
and uh we're going to stay kind of
chilly as we go into the overnight hours
tonight and then again tomorrow we've
got severe weather all of our big storms
these are all down across southeastern
parts of the u.s mississippi parts of
alabama quite a few
tornado warnings throughout the daytime
hours today that is heading away from us
but look at the next wave
i'm building in nebraska parts of kansas
colorado
down through the panhandles of oklahoma
and texas so that backside here
all this mess is going to rotate in
as we go into the daytime hours tomorrow
and you got to remember
it's kind of chilly out there so uh we
are going to unfortunately
uh if you aren't ready for
spring or if you are ready for spring
we're going to get a little rain snow
mix pushing into the region so
temperatures tonight they drop back to
right around 32
and 33 degrees and then 9 10 11 o'clock
in the morning look at the snow
increasing in our northwestern counties
kind of overtaken by rain but we are
going to have some batches
of rain snow mix
across the region and when we do get
those batches that are all snow it could
actually come down at a pretty good clip
but look at our temps we're sitting 40
ish degrees at the surface so that means
it's at freezing above the surface so a
few thousand feet up
so that's why you get some snow mixing
in but there is going to be some snow
mixing in i
just to cover
my backside if we had any accumulations
it would be light and it would melt
pretty much on contact but we're going
to watch this as we go into the morning
hours most of this is going to be out of
here by mid afternoon and then we start
to clear out as we go into tomorrow
night all right friday looks pretty good
temperatures will start into the 30s but
we're going to warm
into the 60s for highs actually mid 60s
during the afternoon here we go again
friday night next little wave showers
start to press in maybe even a few
thunderstorms friday night into saturday
morning but i think saturday overall is
going to be looking pretty good
most of the day is going to be fine we
are going to have the clouds and showers
early to start late sunday thunderstorms
are going to roll in
uh late sunday sunday night into monday
it's not
looking severe
but we're kind of teetering with it so
we're going to have to watch that over
the next few days of course we're almost
into april our severe weather season
really likes to ramp up especially once
we get past about april 20th so uh but
something we'll watch and i'll keep you
updated um i'm gonna do the daily
youtubes on here so
