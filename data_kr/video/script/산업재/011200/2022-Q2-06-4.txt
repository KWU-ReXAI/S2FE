valley of the shadow of death, 
I will fear no evil, for you

staff, they comfort me, thou 
preparest a table before me in 
the presence of my enemies. You 
anoint my head with oil, my cup 
overflows and surely. God All 
the days of my life and I will 
dwell in the house of the Lord 
forever and ever amen. Assalamu 
alaikum. Welcome to Johnny's 
Bite. Good morning. It's 
Monday. Over the weekend, I had 
cause to travel towards the 
Kaswa area. Now, my 
understanding is that the 
situation I'm about to show you 
has been the result of the 
rains, the first rain that we 
saw which you remember the 
mingles, we had gone to the 
mingles at the Flamingo area, 
how their home had been, you 
know, washed away literally. 
This is happening in Kaswa. 
Where two or three communities 
have been cut away. They've 
been separated Because a bridge 
that had a culvert has been 
washed away. Oliver, play that 
video for me quickly. And and I 
know that the members of 
parliament for the area, Howard 
Kumsin, Gisela Tete, they have 
all been there. They've gone to 
give them hope and vibes. But 
this is their situation. So 
this gentleman got there and he 
couldn't wait. So he had to go 
through it. Now check it out. 
Take a look at it. Just at how 
the the gentleman is going to 
navigate the water. and they 
had put ah what do you call it 
the the 22 branches of bamboo 
there. 
The black man is also a human 
being. And this is in Ghana. 
this is in greater, no, no, no, 
central region. This is it. 
This is this is how the 
somebody is living. So, if you 
live on the other side, well, 
Oliver, there's a gentleman 
there. There's an Alhaji there. 
He he he spoke to us. Play his 
video for me. His house is on 
the other side. Eh, he can't go 
home. His house is there oh. 
But he can't go home. Not that 
he has done anything bad at 
home oh. But he just can't go 
home. Play the video. Oliver. 
You gotta fall. 
area had eh 10 years to 12 
years bridge this is the main 
bridge hm this is the bridge in 
hm 
and okay 
catering eh happen 
very long time story bringing a 
party apache yeah, yeah, yeah. 
So this is it. Now, check it 
out. There's a military man I 
saw across. You see, that's the 
motorbike park there. Oliver 
pause. Come back a bit and 
pause. Well, if I come back a 
bit and pause, pause. Now, 
there's a motorbike ahead The 
two people were on the 
motorbike. So, they were riding 
to the place. They thought they 
were crossing over. When they 
got there, they saw they saw 
their smoothness level. That 
was when they decided that we 
cannot do anything about it. 
So, the soldier man in the 
raincoat had to now walk 
through the water to come up to 
the next point. Now, imagine if 
you have Bellamundi or Helen 
Apiam or who cannot walk 
through the water. Mm. Water go 
carry them. Water will carry 
them if Bella had a home there. 
So now, I'm wondering how is it 
that this has happened for more 
than a month? And the shocking 
part is that one person died 
there. Because he left home in 
the morning, knowing that the 
bridge was complete, and there 
was no problem there. He was 
coming back in the evening. 
Alright, in the evening, and 
then this situation had 
happened, he drove, he rode 
straight into it, bam. Smashed 
his head, he's dead. A week 
ago. Just one week ago, this is 
Kaswa Oklu, Nkwanta, the houses 
you will see there. And I'm 
sure that the assemblies go 
round though and collect their 
property rate. I am very very 
sure the assemblies go there to 
collect their moneys. Oliver, 
there's another video, play it, 
Stop repeating the videos. Play 
another video. About 6 videos. 
Play them. Play them. Let the 
people see how desperately the 
people. Look at it. Pause. look 
at the gap. East. Look, look 
at, look at the gap. Created 
and you know, the more we leave 
it, the more it expands. The 
more you leave it, the more it 
destroys. Now, it's getting 
closer to the homes of people. 
I am told how Akumsi has been 
there. May this how Akumsi good 
morning to you. I am told 
Gizeel Athete has been there. 
Good morning to you madam. The 
MMDCs, they have been there. 
Good morning to you. This is 
the junction. After the police 
barrier, you take a left turn, 
you are straight onto Okoro 
Kwanta. Now, this is the 
situation they have. Show me 
the gutter again. I want I want 
them to feel and see the 
gutter. And you see if you 
don't use this, you have to go 
back and use the, that, this 
connects all the way to eh, 
ehm, what do you call it? Eh, 
in Salam. That Obom road, it 
connects you in. So if you 
don't use this, you have to go 
and find your other 
alternative, which means that 
more fuel, and that road is 
even not the best of shapes. 
Guess what? They have market 
days on Tuesdays and Fridays. 
So tomorrow, when Arise Ghana 
will have their demonstration, 
it will be a market day. If I, 
I had a market day, and my road 
is divided into two, like this, 
without a division sign. How am 
I supposed to survive? So 
that's what I'm asking, how am 
I supposed to survive? And I'm 
using this as a connection to 
many, many, many, many, many 
other difficulties that people 
go through. There are roads. 
Rhodes minister, good morning 
to you. Minister for works and 
housery, good morning to you. 
Sorry. Good morning to you. I'm 
just saying pause. Come back to 
where the gutter is destroyed. 
So you can show them. I'm just 
saying good morning to all of 
you. Eh have a good morning to 
you. Good morning to you. Your 
MMDCs, good morning to you. 
Rhodes Minister Makwata, good 
morning to you. Eh eh eh Asan 
works and housing minister, 
good morning to you. Nadmo 
coordinator, good morning to 
you. You don't like for your 
name to be mentioned. When we 
mention your name, then you get 
angry. But we are only calling 
you to go and do your work. 
Good morning to you. Good 
morning to all the assembly men 
who are there. Good morning to 
you. I'm just saying good 
morning. So you know how your 
people are suffering. This is 
how your people are travelling 
now. And look at the length of 
that coconut tree. It should 
tell you how deep and wide. 
This is. This is in Kaswa oh. 
They say oh, move to higher 
grounds, move to, now the 
higher grounds is becoming open 
grounds. 
the higher
 grounds western 
region minister say oh when you 
move to higher grounds you must 
have plan B this is somebody's 
plan B the plan B cry is 
widening. So move to higher 
grounds. And I had to take my 
time to film this myself. 
Because we are travelling on 
that road. So what it meant it 
was that all the journey we had 
we had come thus far, we had to 
return and go all the way back. 
In this economy where fuel is 
now 10 cities, 99 pesos. Per 
liter oh, not a gallon, per 
liter. Eh later, once more, eh 
glassy juice, per liter. 
you are, you are wasting fuel 
market day tomorrow and Friday 
will be affected. People cannot 
go to their homes. If they want 
to, they want to rescue, they 
have to go through the process 
the young man went through. The 
gap is widening, which means 
that the water is getting close 
and there's a poultry farm 
there, can you imagine if this 
thing goes haywire? the gush of 
the water that's flowing. Check 
it out. It means that it will 
flood homes. And we are 
watching. As usual, we are all 
watching. Even the road that 
connects to that community. 
From the junction, the road 
that connects to that 
community, the Oklum Kwanta, 
all the way from the junction, 
after the police barrier, 
terrible. So you now you're 
asking yourself, okay, they're 
asking me to to higher grounds. 
Okay, I'm going to a place that 
I feel would have you know, 
show the road. Oliver, show me 
the road. That's the road. Now, 
you branch here, and the road 
from this point all the way 
down to where I showed you, is 
bad. Oliver, I sent you the, 
the, the, video of the, the 
contractor. The contractor has 
moved away from site. The 
contractor who was doing the 
road, he has moved away from 
site. The contractor has moved 
away from site. Why? I don't 
know. I don't know how and why 
the contractor moved away from 
site But the contractor has 
moved away from site. And his 
vehicles are parked there. The 
contractor's vehicle has parked 
there. I was told somebody 
died, the one person died 
there. So why are we not paying 
the contractor? Why is the 
contractor moved away from 
site? And why do we have this 
situation? Can't we buy covert? 
Is there is there a a matter of 
meet and greet going to show 
our faces and talk to them so 
give them vibes and takashi 
small and leave a place? Our 
people are suffering. that's 
what I want our authorities to 
know this morning. Our people 
are suffering. And if people 
are suffering this way, and yet 
you tell them that you make 
Ghana better for them. You 
should bow down your heads in 
shame. you should bow down your 
heads in shame. Well, you may 
have a V eight. So you can 
drive through other roads that 
are not good and still not feel 
it. The more brawa who had to 
come and park his motorbike at 
the other end and walk through 
and leave the motorbike there, 
not know if the motorbike will 
be stolen or not. That's what 
I'm talking about. 
That's 
the condition I'm 
talking about. And I will play 
this thing until that place is 
fixed. Kaswa, Oklu The MPs, 
they know what I'm talking 
about. Ah, no, no, no, they 
know what I'm talking about. 
The MPs are well, they have 
been there. They went there to 
give the people vibes. Now 
that's the contractors eh, 
place. Check it out. The 
contractors have packed out. 
They have rented I think a 
four-bedroom house. Uh my 
information has told me, 
four-bedroom house for the 
people to live there. Now, this 
is, these are their equipment, 
cars, the trucks. They are 
parked out. In fact, my 
information is that they used 
to have about four of the 
trucks. They have moved two 
away. The four yellow, the 
yellow one, they have moved two 
away. That's it. And they have 
moved out. Contractor. So we 
owe contractor, we won't pay. 
The road is bad, we won't do 
it. The people collect their 
property rate, we will give 
them. Now eh eh Oklum Kwanta is 
destroyed. We are watching. So 
we, we, as citizens. When you 
tell us that you want to make 
our lives better. What exactly 
do you mean? 
I'm asking
, when you tell us 
you want to make our lives 
better, what exactly do you 
mean? Because the contractor is 
on site, you don't pay him for 
whatever reason, the contractor 
packs his bag and budget and 
leaves. The house he has rented 
for the people which is part of 
his overhead course is still 
there. The boys are still 
sleeping there, but the show 
the video, show the video of 
the contracted stuff. I don't 
show my face. Do I look like a 
contractor? This is the 
contractor's place. at the 
vehicles. You see the the way 
the grass has grown You see, 
you see what's happening? The 
man has practiced by he's 
frustrated obviously. I can 
imagine how many certificates 
he has, he has generated and he 
has not been paid. But this 
road was moving smoothly. 
Government change. We don't 
mind. As soon as government 
changes, poop, we don't care. 
Maybe as a contractor's 
machines. Now, Oliver, take me 
back to the gutter. I wonder, 
that's my last video, then we 
go. Take me back to the gutter 
that's been washed away, the 
gap that's been created. Once 
you show me that, we'll go 
home. Show me the gap. How I 
come say, good morning to you. 
Good morning to you. MMDC is 
good morning to them. 
Assemblyman, good morning to 
you. Stop the honorable, 
honorable guy, fix the road 
there. 
Go and fix the road. Two 
communities have been have been 
divided into two without the 
division sign. Honorable 
honorable. 
Go and do the work. This is 
your job. Look at how your 
constituents are walking 
through bamboo. As if there are 
some eh they are doing some 
TikTok video. Look at it. Look 
at your people. How they live? 
How they survive? And the gap 
is why they even when Moses 
moved the people through the 
Red Sea. This was not how wide 
it was. saw it in my my book of 
bible story sir. Your people 
are walking through like this. 
Let's just pause. That's a 
soldier man there. That's a 
soldier man. His motorbike is a 
that's the Okada rider. They 
couldn't cry. When they got 
there, they were shocked. I 
asked the boss. I said The 
soldier man said it. Of course 
he's a soldier man. So he came 
through it. But the Okana rider 
left him there and went back. 
So good morning to you. MP 
Rhodes Minister. Hurry up. If 
you say we are not fixing 
roads, hurry up. This is a road 
for you to fix, boss. Go and 
fix it. 
Minister for works and housing.
