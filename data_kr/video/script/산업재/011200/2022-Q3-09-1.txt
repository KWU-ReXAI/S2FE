this attack started becoming frequent
after
the us troops were deployed in may by
president biden i do not want to
speculate but that's a big coincidence
and i understand why people feel that
way
hello fam welcome back to my channel
photos if you're new i am on gil zalalam
and today i want us to talk about the
attack that somalia faced by the
al-shabab
they lost more than 20 people and more
than 100 people are injured somali
forces ended a deadly 30-hour siege of a
hotel in the country's capital with
security personnel clearing explosive
planted by al-shabab fighters and the
damaged building this is so sad taking
away innocent people's lives and the
reason why i wanted to talk about this
is because now we're hearing it more and
more al-shabab is claiming for terrorist
acts not just in somalia just last month
they were caught in ethiopia thankfully
there was a swift action that was taken
so they were not able to take lives and
the president is assuring us that
they'll pay for it good i'm glad he's
promising that but at the same time
we hear the rumors going around we hear
what people are saying and as you know
this attack started becoming frequent
after
the us troops were deployed in may by
president biden i do not want to
speculate but that's a big coincidence
and i understand why people feel that
way at the end of the day we don't have
good examples or good history when it
comes to foreign troops in our land
there is always something that will go
wrong when there's a foreign troop in
our land and we've been saying that not
just in somalia we've talked about in
mali we've talked about in burkina faso
we've talked about drc
it's like
they come
to the continent claiming that they will
help us and i understand like if
somebody
tells you that they want to help you you
might be persuaded to say okay but at
the same time when they're here and
you're not seeing the results not just
that you're actually seeing a negative
result you're actually seeing the
terrorists multiply and getting bold and
getting fundings and getting firearms
and you know creating chaos you have to
question certain things you have to
examine certain things so
yeah i just want to leave you with that
thought like let me know down below what
you think about that and also if you're
from somalia please please let me know
down below i really want to know what
are your thoughts what are people saying
or what are people thinking about the
new president how do they feel about him
do people like him are people suspicious
of him because i understand the previous
president
for major people really liked so i want
to know about this guy before you know i
make my assessment anyways fam let me
know down below what your thoughts are
about this and i also want to give my
condolences to all those that lost their
family members and i want to end this by
saying rest in peace
