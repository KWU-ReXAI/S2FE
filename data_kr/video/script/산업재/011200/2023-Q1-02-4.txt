if most New Testament Scholars don't
take the gospel seriously why should we
actually the premise of that question is
false most New Testament Scholars at
least take the major Contours of the
gospels Matthew Mark and Luke as being
historical so that Jesus formed 12
disciples that followed after him that
he had a Ministry of doing Miracles or
at least it was perceived that he did
miracles did he reached out and cared
for the marginalized they had a
remarkable treatment of women that he
was crucified by Pontius Pilate and his
closest followers believed he had risen
from the grave it's simply false that
most New Testament Scholars don't take
seriously Matthew Mark and Luke on the
major Contours of those Gospels
