mother's desk in Brooklyn this is a long
time I was young and there's a picture
of a roach a cockroach on a can like a
paint can a 5 gallon pan can and sitting
on his desk I said dad what the hell is
that the Cockroach was turned upside
down dead and it said the name of the
product was Bye by roach and my father
said you know this stuff is the greatest
stuff we've ever used but it's too
expensive I don't like it so I'm sending
it up to your uncle MIT they're going to
ask analyze it he's going to send it
back and tell me what ingredients are in
I said what are you doing Dad you said I
can say four $4 a gallon I say pop is it
really worth it he said yeah it's worth
it that's the way you make money and to
a certain extent you know it's not
Pennywise you got to save the pennies
you got to be that's a great thinking so
he wants to take something that's
expensive that's good and send it up to
a laboratory at MIT find out what the
ingredients are because he can save a
couple of dollars a gallon
