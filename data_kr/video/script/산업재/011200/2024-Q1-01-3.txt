sometimes while a parliamentary division
is underway MPS will talk to each other
while holding a piece of paper over
their heads why do you occasionally hold
a piece of paper over your head can you
tell me about that okay this is a this
predates the Australian Parliament so
the
rule when you want to speak is you have
to stand up when you want the attention
of the chair you have to stand up when
you're in a division you're not when
you're voting when you're voting yep
you're not allowed to stand up
so how they used to get the attention of
the speaker they used to put a top hat
on right because a top hat would make
you taller as though you were standing
right that was the concept in the
parliament most of the time we don't
have access to a top hat um and
therefore people get the most random
creation of a hat they can find which is
usually a piece of paper on the
head
