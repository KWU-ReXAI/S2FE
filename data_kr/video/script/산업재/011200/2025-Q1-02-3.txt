hi there Lyn Ames with another in the
series things that make you go hm in
this case however it's something that
makes me go you have got to be kidding
me I want to talk about neo-nazism I
want to talk about Nazis I want to talk
about fascists no I don't want to talk
about any of these things but it seems
that I must I
must so
seriously our vice president right JD
Vance went to Munich Germany to an
International Security
conference and
lectured lectured our peers our
allies about free speech and not just
any kind of Free Speech but the kind of
free speech he said that should give a
Neo-Nazi party in Germany of all places
a place in
government Ka Vance was speaking not for
himself in this role but for the
American people are you all okay with
this where is the outrage on the part of
the media on our part every Democrat
every Republican every independent this
on the heels of Elon musk's Nazi salute
and yes that's what it was let's call it
what it was because that's exactly what
he did on a world stage and then he
entertained the afd which is the farri
Neo-Nazi party in Germany and then Vance
met with the same party while he was
busy
dissing the premier of
Germany seriously people we cannot stand
for this in our country we cannot
normalize this this is not acceptable on
any level what are you going to do about
it what am I doing about it I'm writing
to my congressman I'm writing to my
senator I'm calling them I am calling
upon all good
people and I know that most of us are
that to stand up and say never again and
not in this country not now not ever
things that make you go uh-uh not on my
watch
