earlier samsung sdi began lagging behind
sk on in global market share since last
july the battery manufacturing unit of
samsung has focused more on enhancing
its profitability as its management has
emphasized qualitative growth based on
technical skills and reduced emphasis on
quantitative growth if we focus on
quantitative expansion without a
qualitative growth this may cause
irrevocable problems samsung sdi ceo
choi yunho said last month we should
pursue qualitative growth based on
thorough precautionary inspections and
products that can dominate the market in
contrast the subsidiary of sk innovation
has made aggressive global investments
joining hands with foreign car makers to
expand its presence in north america we
surprised the market by receiving an
unprecedentedly large amount of orders
sk on ceo g dong siap said last month we
received more orders from global car
makers securing new clients eskeon and
ford established a joint venture named
blue oval sk and agreed last year to
invest 11.4 billion dollars to build eva

its third factory in michigan the two
companies said the joint venture will
unveil the location of the fourth

memorandum of understanding with
stalantis last october to establish a
joint venture for the production of
battery cells and modules they have yet
to sign a contract for the building of
the factory in the u.s we are in talks
with another car maker but at this
moment it is difficult for us to mention
details samsung sds senior vice
president michael sun said january 27th
in the company's conference call on its
fourth quarter earning in another
apparent effort to gain trust from
global car makers samsung sdi also
decided late last month to voluntarily
recall
1163 high voltage battery packs
installed in around 100 plug-in hybrid
vehicles of ford and stalante the
company said it made the decision after
discovering welding issues which could
cause sudden loss of drive power
