but is it really green transport if it's
not sustainable the Reese and recycling
of batteries is becoming just as
important as producing more efficient
and cheaper batteries Korean companies
such as mintech work with battery and
electric vehicle Farms to help them
reuse old batteries
electric vehicle batteries can be reused
even after the vehicle has been scrapped
because they are usually in good
condition
while the Korean government is
bolstering its electric vehicle and
Battery production with subsidies it
seems that their next task will be to
step up its efforts in battery recycling
