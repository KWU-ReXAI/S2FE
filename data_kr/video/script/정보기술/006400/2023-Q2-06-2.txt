as the automotive industry evolves our
highly skilled Workforce is in demand to
design and produce the next generation
of vehicles and components we are
thrilled General Motors and Samsung SDI
recognize the strength of the Region's
Workforce and have selected our
community for their EV battery project
the shovel ready site the Confluence of
infrastructure and geographic location
position the Indiana Enterprise Center
as the perfect fit for this
transformational project the project is
possible thanks to the hard work and
vision of the local and state Economic
Development teams a project of this
scale requires a collaboration and
Partnership of many agencies departments
and individuals
over the last year and a half thousands
of hours have been devoted to this
project and we would be remiss to not
thank our partners at the county Jared
Huss of Lawson Fisher in the town of New
Carlisle Jacob klosinski of the city of
South Bend as well as Shelley klug in
the entire AEP team we also want to
recognize and thank the people of New
Carlisle for their support and patience
throughout the project so this is the
largest single economic development
project in Indiana's history at three
and a half billion dollar project so
1600 new jobs coming to the South Bend
region has got us really excited we
expect a number of suppliers will follow
as well on the GM project alone about a
600 plus million dollar economic impact
every single year with just the jobs
alone that are created in there so we
were pretty excited about what that
means for it I think the other piece
that has me really excited is is really
us again being at the center of the
automotive industry and the evolution
that's happening there historically
Studebaker was one of the big four
automakers if you went back 100 plus
years I actually even ended 1800s so
much Automotive Innovation happened here
we're now in at the ground floor of
General Motors and their electric
vehicle future GM's a known commodity a
terrific partner has a big presence in
Indiana already we're excited that
they've picked St Joe County as their
next site and we look forward to this
project to getting started
