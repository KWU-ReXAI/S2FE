Samsung SDI Hungary has a long history of over 20 years
Originally, it did not start with battery business
It started with display Business CRT, and PDP
SDI Hungary was the production site for PDP until 2014
Then in 2016, an MOU was signed with a Hungarian authority
to turn it in to production center for electrical vehicle batteries
SDI Hungary tops any other SDI manufacturing plants, 
in terms of its volume and scale
It was a huge plant site with the area of 500,000 square meters until late 2022,
which will expand up to 1,200,000 square meters after the completion of Plant 2
SDI Hungary site is so huge that we need a shuttle to get around the plant
We have over 7,000 enthusiastic and passionate people team from over 20 countries
People of such diverse culture backgrounds
all join here in Hungary to the stabilization of the plant
Do you know why?
It's because all of them know very well that the industry which they are taking part is in the global spotlight
And because electric cars are the future,
so they very well understand how crucial and valuable their role is
The batteries made in Hungary plants are driving cars all around the world 
With the EV market’s rapid growth,
we are confident and sure that
SDI Hungary will mark a monumental page in Samsung SDI's history
I am feeling the heat of the people passion and industry's attention,
