although they could not predict the
exact moment when this place they were
getting prepared for almost 10 years ago
or 20 years ago you know the time will
come when the the group control must be
transferred from one generation to the
next you know so they prepared this for
many many years as we all know very well
in 1999 Samsung SDS decided to issue
what's called bws bonds with warranties
at a very discounted price uh well below
the market price and it's it's been
challenged by many shareholders and many
stakeholders and later in year 20 n
after the special prosecutors uh was
done key parties of Samsung group was
found guilty that they have violated
some law some existing laws and that's
the case how you know JY Lee EJ got
possession of you know Samsung SDS it
turned out out that now it's going IPO
he was able to realize lots of profit
almost 280% folds what he spend to buy
that steak and now he's becoming one of
the richest men in this country
