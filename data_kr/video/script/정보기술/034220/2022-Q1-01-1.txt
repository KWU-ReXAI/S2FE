i think lg display calls the media chair
but i call it the throne of awesome and
to play classic board games digitally on
its 24 or 32 inch hd touch screen i just
feel like they're gonna
come after news anchors
it seems like every company has some
sort of an implementation for micro
mobility to get you from a to b uh but
ultimately honda's was a little bit
different they have these things called
pnds or plug and drive modules they're
like little automated motorized caster
wheels that you can put on anything the
idea being that you could definitely put
them on a small personal mobility device
to take you to the bus or to the airport
or something like that they even showed
them on tables in offices for example to
have workspaces move around you and
adapt to your needs instead of you
moving from one room to the next maybe
the room just kind of rearranges itself
around you to become whatever you need
and that's a really interesting concept
a simple technology that with the right
know-how on the right implementation
could be pretty powerful

infinity game table has you sit with up
to five other family members or friends
to play classic board games digitally on
its 24 or 32 inch hd touch screen it
could be monopoly scrabble battleship
candy land these are all built in over
60 of them or you can download other
games the problem at my house mark is
that with the three between the three
kids that i have will lose one of the
pieces to the board game you know the
dice or the chips or the pieces
everything's right there digital
my favorite concept product is something
lg display calls the media chair but i
call it the throne of awesome this thing
has a 55 55-inch curved oled tv attached
to a chair that reclines and looks damn
cool doing it one of the coolest things
this display can rotate from vertical or
portrait mode into landscape mode
although i'd love to have one of these
things at home
lg display says a more practical use
would be in something like a first class
airport lounge and it's kind of scary to
see just how stunningly human-like she
is a robot that wakes up and twists its
face in the grimace of shock and then
examines its hands in disbelief now not
only is
amica's movements exceptionally fluid
but look at its face that seems totally
natural as for the technology experts
say amica's combination of mechanical
limbs and ligaments joints and sensor
arrays is cutting edge but guys aside
from just marveling at amica a lot of
people are pretty terrified folks are
making references to movies like the
matrix and terminator wondering if we
really are getting closer to robots
taking over the world because i i just
feel like they're going to
come after news anchors finally meet the
king of massage chairs body friends
pharaoh o2 here we go oh now it's
starting i feel it it's oh wow premium
speakers voice control and a burst of
oxygen to relax and rejuvenate but
before you get too comfy keep in mind

this and i'll be done for the rest of
the day thank you see you later see you
