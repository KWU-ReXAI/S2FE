I'm here from sap at the LG CNS Booth
it's really impressive ARA has fantastic
functionalities for indirect procurement
LG CNS has extended some of those
functionalities and built incredible
capabilities in the space of direct
procurement as well so with that I like
the product so far and I like how you
can download the data for me and create
a rule and based on the statistic uh
information to give me suggestion what
the data to use for future testing the
advantage of perfect spin that we see we
just touched it in the speech is when we
look at the real transaction data and
that volume the Gap isn't just small
it's Millions what we can do is close
that gaps is why s and LG and po are
working together to really adopt that
change it's awesome we are look forward
to get all the experience from these
events and then Implement back to our
customers and value to our customers
