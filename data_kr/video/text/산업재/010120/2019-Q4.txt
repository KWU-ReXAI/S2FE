 먼저 leaving is 수신 아스햄끼 LORD study where would you install an HMI? pretty much be installed anywhere you want to control or monitor any device machines, power panels, production lines we have some different applications machine control, food and beverage plant, boiler control you could use it as SCADA system power monitoring, or some switch-gear, perhaps. Water treatment plant would be a good one. Just to display and monitor values at the same time. The middle one on the bottom here is production status display. This one actually has a video output. 그리고 맛 Jerusalem을 시 vào Xuan注 gob 그리고 이 끝에 또한, 저희는 미국에서 하는 흥미로운 작업을 보여 드리겠습니다. 지금 이 테이블을 볼까요? 사이즈가 조금 이상합니다. 사이즈가 4인치에 맞게 시작되고, 15인치에 올라갑니다. 미국에서 하는 EXP가 있었습니다. 작년 9월에 시작되었습니다.

Belih whoever 고�igan c memory increases a lot, so this is flash memory which is available for your project up to 1GB flash memory and then project memory is 128MB, so you can make a much bigger program if you have an application that's going to be pretty complex you're going to be monitoring a lot of things, there's a lot going on, a lot of screens or whatever of course all that takes up more memory for your project, so you might need to go to an IXP2 RAM, DDR2 RAM, which will make the HMI more responsive and I think we mentioned on another slide that the IXP2 actually has a dual core 1GHz processor, so overall it's a faster computer I mean these are just computers with built-in touch screen, so the IXP2 is going to be a better performer Ethernet channels 1 on the EXP, 2 Ethernet channels on the IXP2, otherwise everything else is going to be the same so serial connector is RS232, we'll give you one of those on both of them, 422 is 485 and let's see, question, previous slide showed you only have IXP2 SP card, this shows both it's probably a typo, yeah, so only the IXP2 has a spot for the SD card, so that's a good question, this might be saying yeah, SD card, yeah, there's no SD card slot on the EXP, so that might be a typo so let's see, video output, the HDMI port is only on the IXP2, again it's not a requirement, not many times people are using external monitor in addition to the HMI, but if that's something somebody wants, they could use the IXP2 there's also the 3.5mm jack for sound output, which we'll show you a little bit more about that too these are also all rated for IP66, so NEMA type 4X rating, power, even though they give you all these power options here, 12V, 24V, 110V, 220V the only ones we stock are 24V DC, so all of those are rated for IP66, so that's a good question so this is what I was mentioning, one of the most prevalent questions I get from people, which is some people say that we don't have enough power, so we need to have more power, but we don't have enough power so we need to have enough power to be able to use the XPS2, so we need to have enough power to be able to use the XPS2 so this is what I was mentioning, one of the most prevalent questions I get from people, which is supported controllers or drivers, they're commonly called, so this is what PLC, what controller, what protocol can I connect up to for our HMI so the longest list you're going to see here of course is our own stuff, LSIS stuff, so these are all of our PLCs CPU units, Ethernet units, you can connect directly to the inverters, I have a project I have that I could show you guys that connects up the HMI directly to our drives, so the longest list is LSIS and then you're going to find stuff like Koyo for their directnet PLCs, or PLCs that communicate directnet, Mitsubishi, Omron, Panasonic let's see what else we got here, so the most common question, I think you guys could probably agree is Rockwell is the number one request that we get, hey can we communicate Rockwell, yes we can right here we have the list for compact and control logics over ethernet, micrologics over ethernet, even the older SLC series compact logic, DF1, all the DF1 protocols, so that's all there, we can also do Schneider, since they're the guys that claim Modbus we could communicate to any Modbus device pretty much, so this is kind of like a generic driver when we use Schneider we have a backnet IP, good for the HPAC guys, Hitachi, so I mean even if you guys have a customer that's not 100% on board with like LS drives and stuff like that, this might be an opportunity where you could get in there with the LS HMI at least as long as the driver is something that we have that will support with them so let's see a couple of questions here, I guess I'll answer them as we go, is this list available to be shared with us? yes, so this list is actually right out of the catalog, so let me just bring up the catalog here alright, so this is also on our website too, but I'm just going to show you I just downloaded it of course on my computer, so here is the catalog alright, so hopefully you guys can see this catalog, and I think drivers are towards the back, so here is IXP2, here is EXP, there is nice comparisons in here of what's available and stuff very similar to what we are talking about in these slides right now we got to go to the back, let's go to slide 40 here is the list of communication drivers is what they call it here so you guys can always find this list or find this catalog and it would be something good to have and then also we are going to post this video online and I can also share the slides I think most of you guys have my email, I'll put it up at the end so you guys can email me if you want to copy these slides or whatever if you want to use them as a sales tool or whatever alright, so let's see, is the NEMA 4X the default rating on the IXP2 yes, so there is no options like I want this rating or I want that rating it's pretty much going to be all IP66, NEMA 4X out of the box so that's a good question, they all have the same ratings alright, here is one more, so this shows some Siemens stuff Logo Ethernet Bekoff Yaskawa if any of you guys do with them so it's a little bit of everything and this list is expanding usually too so if there is anything that's not on here it might be on here in the near future so now we are going to switch over to talking primarily about the IXP2 series mainly because there is more to talk about for the IXP2 series again, the EXP is like the entry level and I think the E is like for the more economical entry levels what the E stands for whereas the IXP2 is like a level up cost goes up but features and things like that change so here is the IXP2 because it's the second generation one and the I on this one is intelligent so it's a higher level product this one features like an all aluminum frame so that's where they say aluminum body it has a tempered glass screen whereas the EXP has a plastic like bezel and frame and it has like a plastic touch screen so it's a little bit different supports USB 2.0 which is the same as the EXP you can also run a host device which would be like a USB memory stick you can connect a mouse or a keyboard to this so this is just a computer running Windows software with the a little bit customized for the LSHMI in the back that's that battery access there there's also some dip switches for enabling and disabling various functions and then there's the SD card support these are the kind of things we already mentioned here we're just kind of looking at it again one thing to mention too is this is a UL listed product so that's one of the common things we get asked too usually we, as you guys probably know, we try to avoid selling things in the US or stocking things in the US unless it's UL because that could cause grief when we don't have ULs so here's a little bit about some of the software features and a lot of these software features are only for the IHP2 so the higher level HMI so we can do the dual screen functions and do all the models have touch screen? yes, all of the models the EXPs and the IXPs whether it's like a 4 inch or a 15 inch they all are touch screen so that never changes so the key things that change we're back on like five slides ago which is like the memory and then some of the outputs that's the main thing that changes but if you just need like a basic touch screen you could go with like an EXP so we have the dual screen function connecting up HDMI gestures which we have a slide on so that's kind of what you would expect an HMI to do now where you could scroll up and down instead of hitting a button every time which is a little bit more archaic so we do support gestures which is nice you can connect from a PC to a PLC over ethernet we have the dual port so we could have separate IP addresses for each port and gateways and all that good stuff let's see, we already mentioned the tempered glass display the USB host that's for connecting your mouse or keyboard if you'd like there's some other stuff you could do with that as well which we'll mention in a slide or two this guy has the 1 GHz dual core CPU high resolution so this little arrow here is showing the EXP compared to the IXP2 so we go to a full HD display 1024 by 768 then we could also support the vertical mounting display so you could flip your display from horizontal and vertical and then you can set it up to display like that if you want a little bit more of a longer display up and down, so that's something you could do it's a capacitive touchscreen and then you could also adjust the sensitivity so if you're in an environment for some manufacturing plant where people are wearing gloves you could change the sensitivity for gloves so when people are wearing gloves the screen will be able to respond properly versus bare hands so that's something that's adjustable the 24 bit true color we have a slide on that and then certificates IP66 rated Neva type 4 marine certificate explosion certificate so a little bit of everything there so yeah, the dual core CPU dual core CPU is going to give you a lot better processing time, so you have a lot of screens it's going to be a little bit more responsive it will help with your communications too just because of the more memory higher RAM I think this guy has what is it, one let's see, one megabyte for memory and alarming so that's a function we could utilize then we have a lot more memory so that's a function for the screens and images so if you're going to have something with a lot of screens or pages that you're going to scroll between you'd want to probably go with an IXP if you're doing something more basic I think the IXP would be fine there's a slide that comes up on the explosion certificate so I'll hang tight for a minute and we'll have that pop up for whoever asked that question compared to the previous generation this is like a four times faster overall system that we're running with the IXP2 so here's a little bit more about the color that I've been alluding to is we support the 24 bit color 16 million different colors with the 8 bit alpha channel I honestly didn't know what that meant until I started looking it up but it kind of smooths everything out so you can see that on the left is 16 bit on the right is 24 bit so it makes the gradients a little bit smoother they're not as pixelated so you can make graphics that look a lot nicer essentially with the 8 bit channels and the larger color spectrum on there that's the purpose of that then you can also run the dual monitor mode very simple, HDMI, no proprietary cable or any adapters or anything like that just a straight up HDMI cable so you can connect it from your HDMI to the monitor TV or anything like that so that HDMI is only on the IXP2 so just be aware of that so we do have multiple interfaces that we could use for connecting the various things on the IoT or the Internet of Things so we have the dual channel Ethernet we have a single channel on the EXP so you could always use an external switch if you'd like and the EXP if you have to connect multiple devices we have the HDMI port we mentioned we have the audio output we have the multiple USB ports for different devices and then we could also run a video as well so you could set up a video to come up on the display for like maybe some training purposes or demoing purposes or explanations or whatever so we have the IE66 aluminum frame and the IXP2 and then we also have the multi-touch settings where you could prevent accidental touches pretty much so if you have an operation where people could accidentally start up a machine you can make it where a switch needs multiple touches so you gotta press two fingers on two certain points at the same time and that'll start some kind of critical operation and then again you could adjust the touch sensitivity for bare hands or with gloves here's a little bit about the gestures so it used to be that you'd have to have like a button that would scroll up or scroll down and you'd have to program that button to do the scrolling but now we support gestures for things like monitoring and trending and stuff like that so if you want to display a graph and you want to slide from left to right all you do is swipe just like you're on a phone a lot of people are used to touch screens on their phone or maybe even in their car now with an infotainment system they want to just slide things around and have something happen so we support that as well let's see let me look at some of these questions let's see what should I do should I enlarge or do less for a second alright, yeah, so some of these questions are going to be answered at the end of class so I'll leave them we can't jump ahead of my slides too much and then some of these are long as well so let's see they're approaching I'm going to I'm going to let's see let's see okay alright, yeah, so we'll get back to those questions towards the end I was just seeing if there's anything easy we could answer but we could discuss those at the end this is just kind of showing how you could interface the different devices so you have your HMI which is what we're talking about, right? you could have your ethernet, go to PLC I think we're showing you like maybe LS PLC's here but let's say you're going to a Rockwell PLC which we communicate to you could have this going to like some kind of ERP or ADP or SAP system for like device monitoring and you know, management of products or trending or something like that they're showing like a USB barcode scanner here which could be taking in data into the HMI and displaying it and different inverters which are communicating 45 you could communicate multiple things at once as well you could have different protocols running at the same time because we have different ports on the back, right? we have multiple USB ports, or not USB we have multiple ethernet ports we have multiple 485 ports and 232 ports so you should be able to connect up to mostly anything you need the key would be checking that drivers list, okay? so some other things we could do is we could support MP3 and WAV files so you could have an audio output this works for like if you have a video loaded on the IXP or if you want like as this example is showing here the PLC trips on an alarm that sends it to the HMI maybe an alarm pops up on the IXP2 and then that shoots out to a speaker that says hey an error occurred or system fault or something like that that's totally customizable so we have explosion proof and other standards that we meet so these are the the gas and the dust ratings right here which I think somebody was asking about so hopefully that answers your question which I think is what somebody mentioned, let's see explosion proof C1, D1 I don't know if this is the same one I need to check but yeah this is at least what we list for our gas ratings and our dust ratings so here's another specifications table focusing only on the IXP2 series so there's four different sizes there's 8.4, 10.4, 12.1, and 15 so if you look at the model number it's 0800 would be you know an 8 inch 1000 is a 10 inch, 1200 is 12, 1500 is 15 inch a lot of this we already talked about how many colors we could display the resolution is slightly less on the 8 inch display which you probably wouldn't notice because it's an 8 inch display and then a lot more about the technical details here a lot of this I think we already talked about so we probably don't need to review it again yeah for the rated voltages remember right now we're only stocking the 24 volt DC1 alright so just a little bit about the ease of access ways you can connect on the front of these if you were to pop open this little door here you're going to have a full I think they call it a USB type A port where you could plug in like a plastic and then you can plug in the power so if you're going to do any programming I'd recommend using like a mini USB port it's the most fail safe you know you could also program over ethernet or you could use like a modbus connection or a 232 with like a serial adapter and stuff so there's multiple ways to program these so just keep that in mind I guess it depends on whatever you're used to or whatever you find easiest so I'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that so I'm going to go ahead and show you how to do that so you can find easiest so we kind of already mentioned this front port you can kind of see a little bit better there's a full on USB port there's a mini USB on there and then what you could do with this front USB port is you could change the XP runtime which is like our own operating system on top of this windows software without you know opening up any control panels or going to the back of the HMI you could also use ethernet for transferring projects or doing anything like logging, alarming or transferring recipe data that would probably be best suited for ethernet because that's just overall a faster communication method versus serial another thing you could do is you could take a USB stick with like a program loaded on it and you could dump it into multiple drives you could do a display, dump it into the drive and then you're good to go so you're copying each panel's setup from one to another we could also update the operating system for different drawing files for your HMI program into the HMI so this is a common question we get and I think you guys will find this useful as well is kind of us compared to some of the competition it doesn't cover everybody but it covers some of the competitors so we're comparing ourselves to Proface and Mitsubishi so you can see some of the things are the same we all use TFT color displays here we're showing 12 inch HMI comparison here we have the highest resolution compared to the competition we also have the most colors we have that 16 million color display capacitive touch whereas everybody else is using analog so they're using slightly older technology so capacitive touch is what all the smartphones use now so that's kind of the latest trend for HMI's as well we could do gestures whereas the other guys cannot so I'll just pick out some of the things we have advantages of so we have one gigabyte or one gigabit ethernet port whereas Proface has that but Mitsubishi does not we have a higher memory capacity we have three USB ports on there whereas Mitsubishi only has two and then we have more memory than Mitsubishi or RAM for processing but Proface has a little more than us so this is just a comparison we're not going to read through all of it you guys can kind of see a little bit of the difference so one thing to note is the difference is that you'll see these guys have IP66F so F means oil resistance we don't have an oil resistance ratings on the IXP-2 yet so just keep that in mind there might be something in the future but not yet some other features and another common question is can we access this HMI remotely? Yes we can we do have XP remote viewer so there's a software you can download and then you could check out what's going on on the HMI you could monitor and control the panel as long as it's connected to ethernet and you set it up to connect to the internet and then you can also set it up on a phone there's an app called VNC app and you could view your HMI, you can click buttons and do things like that as well on a phone so you could run a maximum of four devices on there I think my screen just cut out hopefully it came back so we could run a maximum of four devices at one time so you could have a phone and a couple of computers or whatever connected and there should be no issue and then you could also see there's a level of security on this where you could grant access for people to get on there so that doesn't mean that not anybody could just get on there and start messing with your system so you do have to give them access and then we also have a web server so the web server is nice because you don't need to install any software on your computer or whatever, you only need to set up a driver on the XGT panel on your HMI, you set up the web server driver and then once you connect it to the computer you could pop in the IP address and you could have credentials that you could get into the HMI and then you could access the HMI so you could access multiple HMIs as long as you have the IP address and the credentials to get in there and then there's also multiple functions, you could do device monitoring, you could do your control you could upload different files from the XGT panel, like CSV files for trending and stuff like that and then also we have the XP simulator which is something I'll show you guys shortly I'll load up the files or the software and show you how you connect this up and do various things so this supports simulations on the PC so you can test out your HMI without dumping the program into the HMI and this is also really nice because if you're going to be running it through a PLC, sometimes it's a pain to be constantly updating stuff in the PLC and redownloading it and checking for errors and stuff, so you could make a simulated PLC program and then if you're using all LS stuff, so if you're using an LS PLC which some of you may be dabbling in now, we have an XGT simulator that uses the XG5000 software for the LS PLCs and you could run a simulated LS PLC program so you could have a whole system running virtually on your computer so that's a nice kind of feature as well so here we're just kind of showing how you could do different alarm displays so you could have alarms come up servo error, LS error, device error, communication error, whatever this is on a view, a long list right here, you could send this to an address and then you could have this address go into a like a not trending, but like a data file essentially for saving all the alarms and then with the IXP2 this is only on the IXP2 is you could have a PDF saved into the HMI so you could click like this button here which says PDF view and then it will pop up with a manual or a quick start or some kind of troubleshooting document maybe, so stuff to make it easier for the end user that's operating this HMI so here's just like some references so you'll notice that these are not around here it's Mexico, India, and Korea and stuff, and China so this is what I was shared with from our HMI manager overseas so just some larger projects they've done with some car manufacturers you know, Kia and Hyundai and let me show you guys some things we're working on here so thanks to Mr. Mark Bannon for sending over these pictures these are a few products we've been working on past few months or so, maybe longer but this is EXP so this is the entry level monitor and I think we're still running five screens, no problem a lot of monitors, a lot of displays and controls and stuff we had three I think we had three EXP HMIs those are all connected to like about 15 or so VFDs we're running Modbus RTU and I think we're going to change it over to Ethernet because it was kind of slow with the Modbus RTU but it's set up for control and monitoring of different dryer fans and cooling cooling systems and heaters and heaters at a farm like a drying system so the nice thing, or I guess the cool thing about it is it's all LS you can see all LS S100s here larger IS-7 drive HMIs that are LS and then in these power panels it's all LS contact, there's manual motor starters and stuff this is a project that we've been working on again, thank you to Mark for sending over these pictures there's another project we're working on this is my data logger, this one is using the IXP2 HMI and he's also using an LS PLC and this one is using it to control high frequency power supplies and DC power supplies we're doing real time data logging automatic log files we're being backed up, I think under like a USB we had some graphing screens, if you can see here there's all kinds of things being recorded on this HMI and then I think we also had email notifications set up on this one, so that's something you could do as well we didn't talk about here, but you could do email notifications some other things in progress is out east is we're doing Siemens retrofit for their HMI to ours, working on that car wash controller and an aggregate controller was something else we were working on as well so there's lots of applications we could do so I'm going to show you guys a software demo let me first check the questions it looks like there's quite a few I guess I'll start with the most recent so what is the so it was slow because we were running multiple HMIs and drives all on Modbus RTU and it doesn't have enough bandwidth pretty much to support all those devices so the plan is to switch everything over to Ethernet and it should be a lot faster when you're using multiple HMIs on RTU you need to set up like a master slave token pass network and it slows things down a little bit so if you want like a fast response we recommend going to Ethernet can you access VFD parameters over Modbus yes, I'll show you guys my program here in a second and then you'll see that we could run multiple drives and communicate all the parameters without issue I'll come back to some of these questions because there's quite a lot we'll save them for the end so let me show you guys my little software demo here so first off I think I gotta escape out of this here we go so the program you use is called XP Builder so one of the nice things if you may or may not know about LS is we don't charge anything for our software so it's always available at no charge you can download it off of our website download section just go to downloads, click software and then it'll be like the first or second thing to pop up so this XP Builder software there's no licensing required, it's free which tends to be the opposite of some of the other big companies over here so this is an existing program it's a project based software so I open up a project and I'm just gonna go on the bottom left right here is all my screens resolution is showing up okay over the web but if I click this first screen which is in bold that's my base screen so this is explaining what it is this is a sample program that demonstrates how an LS ISHMI can read and write data over Modbus RTU so one of you guys asked a question is hey can we communicate directly to a drive and read and write parameters that's exactly what this program does and you could use either an EXP or an IHP for this program this is a sample program I made for some of you guys that are sales guys or some of you guys that are distributors and you want to show off the product so I could email you guys this and all you do is you dump it into the HMI, you connect two wires from the HMI to the drive set up these four parameters and then you're good to go so this is the first screen this shows how you set it up so it's a run button, a stop button that starts and stops this G100 that you would have connected we're also monitoring all the frequencies, voltages, DC bus all that good stuff so for example let's just double click this button here we can see that we're writing this to address 1 so this is address 1 on our Modbus network and it's sending it to hexadecimal address number 6 so number 6 is your your start command or your control mode and we're sending it a value of 2 because a value of 2 is a forward run and then if we want to stop it we're sending a 3 a 3 is a stop so you would find out these values by using the drives manual and then also in combination with the drives manual you could click help and you could do XP I'm sorry, PLC controller manual and right now we have this set up for an LS inverter so it comes up with like a 10 page manual for the controller you're connected to here's your wiring here's some detailed settings on how you would do things so it makes it pretty easy to find stuff and then let me click the last page here so here's a direct answer to your question is can we read and write parameters? yes we can, so this is actually showing parameter for the cooling fan is AD64 you could click 0, 1 or 2, you could turn the fan on off or only on during temperature control so you could click this and then you could see oh this is actually taking a word and it's writing a number to this word set which is an address so let me show you guys if you click this simulation right here you're not going to see this do too much because there's no PLC program but you could see let's see maybe I'll make this a little bigger you can kind of see that you could click your next screen, your previous screen these are all things that I mapped out beforehand and this project is already completed you could turn the fan off and on and if I was connected to a drive right now and my HDMI was all set up I could turn the fan off and on okay, so just something that somebody could see and hear they hear the fans starting and stopping you'd be able to hit your run button here you'd see your output voltage go up and down that's a little virtual analog meter on there we have some faults and some statuses for stopping and running we're not going to dive too far into this program but again this is something I could send out to you guys if you want just shoot me an email and then I could send it over and we could always discuss it okay, so this was a question that popped up let me make sure I read that question right there's a lot of questions let's see so let's see, experience says this is a hard sale especially for large repeat opportunities and less programming support is in many cases conversion is available what kind of technical support are we offering alright, that's a good question so right now support, you know we don't have enough manpower to be converting programs over for you guys but we're here to help as much as possible so I guess first off I'd recommend utilizing the same support channels that you've been using hopefully for our other products whether it's electro products or VFDs or what have you, you could always give us a call at the 800 number for HMIs and stuff it's better to email us, we have our tech support email because you can always email us programs and we can check it out and stuff so as I mentioned, we can't help you design a program like the one I showed you but we can send you hey, here's a sample program you're free to take it, reverse engineer it and do whatever you want with it but we also want to extend out as much help as we can so if you need help converting a program over or let's say you have I don't know some Rockwell panel view HMI where hey, they do this specific function, can we do that on your HMI? We could definitely help you out with that and make sure that we're capable of doing everything they're doing okay? Yeah, so we're here to help we were trained on the HMI which is priority a year ago so we've gradually increased our knowledge with the more questions and calls and emails we get about it so I think we're pretty good at supporting it, there's not too many unknowns anymore but I'll probably jinx it by saying that and also as far as support, everything is on the website so there's all the software that XP Builder software is on the website, the catalogs are on the website, there's manuals on the website so you guys can download that whenever you'd like we're currently stocking the EXP 40 and 60 and so that's like a smaller one and I think we also have maybe some 4.3s on there as well and then we're stocking the IXP 2s, the 800 the 8 inch, 10 inch and the 15 inch and then we also in the office well at home right now I have a couple too, we have an EXP and an IXP demo unit set up so we can always help you guys out if you have any issues one of the most common questions we get is hey how do I connect up to the software or whatever USB, Ethernet, whatever so once you get that initial set up working then you're usually good to go okay so let's do this alright so I'm going to answer some of you guys' questions and I want to talk about something else here real quick let's see so I answered that technical support question so we're here to help you guys all models are touch screen, yep so all the parameters support from each one of us yeah so that's been good to mention if you guys aren't checking the chat is something that Andy said our sales manager is that we're not I mean there's some guys that are doing like these 1Z, 2Z applications I mean that's fine but what we're really aiming at with these HMI's is to get some repeat business as we're chasing a lot of like larger OEMs so you have an OEM that does 100 HMI's and they're always the same program so that's that's kind of what we're going for because the support will be easier of course the sales volume is better too the 1Z, 2Z stuff I mean you can do it if you want we can't say no but it's not exactly what we're chasing right now let's see yeah single HMI, multiple drives is no problem yeah just slows down when you're using Modbus Andy says we can say no alright so I think I answered most of the HMI questions alright and feel free to send more if you think of them but before we finish here I just wanted to show you something else one of our reps was asking about let's see like I remember where I put this here we go manual I'm going to show you guys our H100 disconnect so here's the flyer also available on our website let me zoom out a tiny bit so you guys can see what it actually is so this is the H100 disconnect switch option so this is offered up to 25 horsepower for 200 volt and then for the 400 volt class it's up to 125 horsepower so this is primarily for the HVAC guys that are going to be using the H100 a lot of times you'll have to have like a built in disconnect or a disconnect within the line of sight that's what the spec says or the code local code so the benefit of using this is it's going to be compact it's inexpensive so this is bolts on to the bottom so I'll show you a manual in a second very easy to install it's going to take five minutes or less it's all LS stuff so this one has an LS MMS on there manual motor starter and then once you hit the larger sizes there's a built in circuit breaker and so let's see so this is meets the UL HC it's a UL type 1 type rating and then the key thing here which I think most of you guys would care about if you get with the HVAC stuff is the short circuit current rating is 100k so that's a common spec in HVAC specs we need 100k we need 100k well if you look right here we use MMS's up to 25 horsepower for the 230v ones that gives us 100k because we have combination ratings for our drive with the MMS and then for the 480v ones for the higher voltage we're using UTS 150 and 250 frame circuit breakers and that gives us 100k as well so here's the dimensions here's kind of how it looks easy to wire easy to install you can use a conduit on it and so the main benefit of this is it's just a disconnect that kind of gets mounted onto the bottom of the H100 I see a question here it says what's the difference between a bypass the main answer for that would be this is not a bypass it's just a disconnect so there's no bypass functionality in here there's no contactors or anything like that let me just bring up this is the manual that shows how you install it switch the actual handle here has a little lock on it well you can purchase a lock and pop it on there for lockout, tagout clock diagram here's all the specs let's see if there's something that shows the installation maybe that's on second page, oh yeah here it is you just remove these two grounding screws and then you just put in those grounding screws back through the enclosure and then it mounts to the top part by the grounding screws and then the bottom part goes into the slots that go on the wall and then it comes with a little pigtail free wires for your three phase that goes right from the top of the circuit breaker or MMS into the input of the drive so you don't need anything extra you just kind of pop it on there really easy, it's a pretty cost-effective solution we have these in stock and they should be on the latest price sheet that you guys have if you don't have the latest price sheet that reflects that let us know let your global regional guy know and they'll send it to you but yeah this is a nice nice option from the factory so it's low cost and it gets the job done and makes sure you meet the spec so that's all I wanted to mention about the disconnect switch so let me just check, I'm going to put these slides back on there let me see if there's any more questions so if you have them asked them now because it's about 11 o'clock and that's all I had to present at least let's see yeah we'll check out the that C1D1 explosion certificate I'll look for that and we could share that with you guys anything like that we could list on the website once I get a hold of it yeah you all approval document I think I have that so I can share that with you as well I'll make sure I save these questions just in case anybody needs them let's see okay yeah one of the main key points of that disconnect box is it's inexpensive and it's easy to install, just a couple screws just pairing the HMI with an LS drive make the programming any easier what are the benefits of pairing this with an LS drive so there's a it's easier because it'll be easier for like John or I to support it because we know more about HMI of course than the other manufacturers but you could communicate the HMI directly with any other drive as long as they're using like a Modbus RTU you can use the generic Schneider Modbus RTU protocol and then it'll connect up so is there room in the disconnect box to put a line reactor? I'm going to say no, it's not designed to fit anything else in there so I wouldn't there might be room but I wouldn't recommend it let's see yes, we do have access to the parameters all register location values are predefined within the HMI wood protocols Modbus let me try to see if I could answer that one about the protocols and stuff so if I go to my project here, my project summary I could click panel settings and right now my controller I only have one controller set up so this is my driver I have my one controller which is my 485 port set up for Modbus and then I could click the manual here and then it pops up with everything for Modbus but since I'm connecting to an LS drive I would want to look at my I want to look at my Modbus table which is something like this so these are all the registers for Modbus for an LS drive so I mentioned like register 6 right? so register 6 is for your operation command so if I just close this temporarily I hit my run button this is set for register 6 so that's how the registers work but let's say I'm using a brand X VFD I would probably go in there and I would change this a little bit I wouldn't use the LS controller I would go and probably use the generic for electric Modbus master RTU you could hit the details you could change your baud rate your data bits, your parity, your stop bits blah blah blah you could change that right now it's going to change my whole project and try to map it all then I would go here and let's say they use an address I don't know 100 you change it to 100 here so the addressing is going to change based on whatever device you're connecting to and also if you're doing Ethernet it changes a little bit too and then also you could also click this little calculator button and you could select your controller so you could do internal memory or internally mapping stuff so you could have internal registers on the HMI of course they could save or do different things for those of you guys that are hanging out it's pretty easy to change stuff on here this is a pre-written program but let's just say I have a bit switch I drag it onto the screen then I address it so let's just click it internal memory spot let's do address one okay oops I think I got to change it to there we go you can change it to an action from an on switch an off switch a momentary switch or an alternative switch you can do a lamp condition where the lamp turns on and off what do you want to happen there's all kinds of rules here there is like a training manual I could send you guys as well so you could use a caption here you could say on switch on switch and then when you turn this on it will say on switch okay so we could actually let's see let's copy that so maybe we could have another training that shows more details about the program or make like a training video or something like that because that's a lot more in depth so I'm going to look at a few more questions here then we'll call it quits let's see yeah so some of you guys I owe answers for on certifications and stuff can you download a program without power I'm assuming that's a question for the HMI no you need to be powered on so 24 of a power supply you could download the program with a USB stick or you could download it you know connected to the software the XP builder okay let's see meaning all the registrations okay so could a UL integrator swap out the MMS with a fused disconnect and maintain UL rating you should be able to you should be able to you should be able to you should be able to but you'd probably want to use like a fused disconnect that is tested with ours so we're like we're tested with Socomac or whatever for disconnects you might want to use something that's listed so all right so I think that was all the questions I saw so if there's any other questions feel free to message us it's right here you can see you can email me directly you can email me directly you can give us a call so thank you guys for coming in and listening and stuff so if you have any questions feel free to shoot us a message so thank you everybody
