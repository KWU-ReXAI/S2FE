**Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:**

- **Implementation of "No Delivery Day":** 
  - A temporary halt in delivery services is being implemented, affecting major courier companies such as CJ Logistics, Hanjin, Lotte, and Korea Post.
  - This pause coincides with a national holiday, effectively extending the delivery break to four days.

- **Impact on Consumers and Businesses:**
  - Consumers are advised to plan their orders considering potential delays, as orders placed today will only be processed starting Monday, the 17th.
  - The expected surge in delivery volume on the 17th may lead to further delays, necessitating careful planning by consumers and businesses.

- **Adjustments by Retailers and Delivery Services:**
  - Some convenience stores, like GS25, have already suspended the acceptance of perishable and urgent goods for delivery.
  - CU will continue to offer limited delivery services for small packages under 5kg using its logistics system.

- **Exceptions to the Delivery Halt:**
  - Companies with their own logistics networks, such as Coupang's Rocket Delivery, SSG.com, and Market Kurly, will continue operations as usual, unaffected by the "No Delivery Day."

**Logical Structure:**

1. **Introduction of "No Delivery Day":** Explanation of the initiative and its participants.
2. **Consumer Advisory:** Guidance on how consumers should adjust their ordering habits due to the delivery pause.
3. **Retailer and Service Provider Adjustments:** Description of how different companies are adapting to the delivery halt.
