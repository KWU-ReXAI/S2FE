**Summary of the Video Transcript:**

- **Context and Issue:**
  - The video discusses the impact of a shortage of urea solution (요소수) on the logistics and delivery industry in Korea.
  - Urea solution is essential for the operation of diesel vehicles, which are commonly used in the logistics sector.

- **Impact on Logistics:**
  - Large trunk vehicles (11-ton trucks) are responsible for delivering packages to distribution points, where smaller 1-ton delivery trucks then transport them to individual homes.
  - The shortage of urea solution has caused some of these large trunk vehicles to halt operations, disrupting the supply chain.

- **Economic Implications:**
  - The scarcity of urea solution has led to increased costs, further complicating the operation of trunk vehicles.
  - Approximately 25% of the fleet, including both trunk and 1-ton delivery vehicles, requires urea solution, indicating a significant portion of the logistics network is affected.

- **Response and Measures:**
  - The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Korea is actively monitoring the situation by collecting data on vehicles that require urea solution from logistics companies.
  - The government is preparing measures to address the shortage and its impact on the delivery industry.

- **Mention of CJ대한통운(120):**
  - Although the transcript does not explicitly mention CJ대한통운(120), it refers to a "large delivery company," which could imply companies like CJ대한통운, given its prominence in the Korean logistics sector.
  - The analysis suggests that major logistics companies are likely experiencing similar challenges due to the urea solution shortage.

This summary captures the main points and logical structure of the video, focusing on the economic impact of the urea solution shortage on the logistics industry and the measures being taken to mitigate the issue.
