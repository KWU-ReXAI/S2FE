It seems that the transcript provided is not coherent or complete, making it difficult to extract meaningful economic ideas, arguments, data, or examples. The text appears to be a mix of different languages and fragmented phrases, which do not form a clear narrative or discussion on economics.

If you have a more complete or coherent transcript, please provide it, and I would be happy to help summarize the key economic concepts and arguments. Alternatively, if you have specific questions or need information on a particular economic topic, feel free to ask!
