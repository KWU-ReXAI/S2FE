#### Investment Strategy Recommendations
- **Additional Purchase Timing**: It is advised to wait for a more definitive bottoming out of the stock before making additional purchases. The current market lacks strong buying interest, and the stock is not yet breaking through significant resistance levels.
- **Opportunity Cost Consideration**: Increasing investment in Doosan now may result in opportunity costs due to the time required for potential positive developments.
- **Target Prices**: The first target price is set at 95,000 to 96,000 KRW, with potential further targets at 110,000 to 120,000 KRW.

#### Conclusion
