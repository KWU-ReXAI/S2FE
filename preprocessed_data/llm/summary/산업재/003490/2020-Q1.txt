**Summary of the YouTube Video on Economics and Finance:**

1. **Korean Air's Capital Increase:**
   - Korean Air (대한항공) held a board meeting to discuss a capital increase of up to 1 trillion KRW.
   - This move is part of efforts to secure liquidity support of 1.2 trillion KRW through government bonds.
   - The capital increase is likely to be conducted through a rights offering followed by a public offering of any unsubscribed shares.
   - Hanjin KAL, which holds about 30% of Korean Air's shares, is expected to hold its own board meeting to decide on participating in the capital increase.

2. **Business Strategy and Asset Sales:**
   - The board did not discuss the potential sale of in-flight meal and aircraft maintenance businesses, which had been considered as part of the company's self-help measures.

3. **Financial Performance and Outlook:**
   - Korean Air is expected to announce its first-quarter financial results soon, with an anticipated operating loss exceeding 200 billion KRW.
   - This marks the first quarterly loss in 18 quarters, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to the suspension of over 90% of international flights.
   - Despite the challenges, cargo sales, which account for about 20% of total revenue, have performed relatively well, potentially mitigating the overall loss.
   - The company plans to resume operations on 32 out of 110 international routes next month, but the second-quarter outlook remains challenging.

4. **Market Communication:**
   - Korean Air plans to disclose detailed information about the timing and scale of the capital increase after the stock market closes.
