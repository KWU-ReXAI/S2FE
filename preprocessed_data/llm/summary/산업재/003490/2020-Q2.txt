### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:

1. **Impact of COVID-19 on the Aviation Industry:**
   - The aviation industry has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with major airlines reporting significant operating losses in the second quarter.
   - Some airlines have not survived the economic downturn.

2. **Surprising Profitability of Korean Airlines:**
   - Despite the challenges, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines reported unexpected profits in the second quarter.
   - Korean Air's revenue was halved compared to the previous year, but it managed to turn a profit due to increased cargo operations.

3. **Role of Cargo Operations:**
   - Cargo revenue for Korean Air surged by approximately 95% compared to the previous year, making up over 70% of total revenue in the second quarter.
   - The decline in passenger flights reduced the capacity for belly cargo (cargo transported in the lower deck of passenger planes), leading to increased cargo rates.
   - The drop in global oil prices and reduced flight operations lowered fuel costs, enhancing cargo profitability.

4. **Innovative Strategies:**
   - Korean Air introduced "cargo seat bags" to transport cargo on passenger seats, maximizing aircraft utilization.
   - Historically, Korean Air has been strong in the global cargo market, ranking 4th worldwide in 2018, excluding cargo-only companies.

5. **Asiana Airlines' Performance:**
   - Asiana Airlines also reported a profit for the first time in six quarters, with a 95% increase in cargo performance.
   - The airline actively sought to transport personnel and expatriates for domestic conglomerates to Vietnam and China.

6. **Cost Reduction Measures:**
   - Both airlines significantly reduced costs, with Korean Air cutting expenses by 50% while revenue fell by 44%.
   - Major cost reductions were achieved through decreased fuel expenses and labor costs.

7. **Labor Cost Management:**
   - Korean Air implemented paid leave for employees, reducing labor costs by 2,000 billion won.
   - The government provided employment maintenance subsidies, covering a portion of basic salaries, but this support is limited to six months per year.

8. **Concerns and Future Outlook:**
   - There are concerns about the sustainability of these measures, as government support may end, leading to potential unpaid leave or layoffs.
   - The reduction in labor costs was crucial for profitability, but it raises concerns about employee welfare and job security.
   - The need for strategies that ensure both company survival and employee well-being is emphasized.
