### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments

#### Impact of COVID-19 on the Aviation Industry
- The aviation industry has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with major airlines reporting significant operating losses in the second quarter.
- Some airlines have not survived the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

#### 대한항공 (Korean Air) and Asiana Airlines' Surprising Profitability
- Despite the challenging environment, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines reported unexpected profits in the second quarter.
- Korean Air's revenue was halved compared to the previous year, but it managed to turn a profit in operating income and net income.

#### Role of Cargo Operations
- The surprising profitability of Korean Air was largely due to its cargo operations.
- Cargo revenue surged by approximately 95% compared to the previous year, with cargo making up over 70% of total revenue in the second quarter, up from the usual 20%.
- The global demand for air cargo decreased due to the pandemic, but the capacity to handle cargo also dropped significantly as passenger flights were reduced by over 90%.
- This led to an increase in cargo rates, benefiting airlines with strong cargo operations.
- Korean Air innovatively used passenger seats to transport cargo, introducing "cargo seat bags" to maximize cargo capacity.

#### Korean Air's Market Position
- Korean Air has historically been strong in the global air cargo market, ranking 6th worldwide in 2018, and 4th when excluding cargo-only companies.
- It holds a significant share of the trans-Pacific cargo market, which is crucial for its operations.

#### Asiana Airlines' Performance
- Asiana Airlines also reported a return to profitability for the first time in six quarters, with a 95% increase in cargo performance.
- The airline capitalized on transporting personnel and expatriates for domestic conglomerates to Vietnam and China.

#### Cost Reduction Strategies
- Both airlines achieved profitability not only through increased cargo revenue but also by significantly reducing costs.
- Korean Air reduced its operating costs by 50%, while revenue decreased by 44%.
- Major cost reductions were achieved in fuel expenses, which dropped by approximately 640 billion won, and labor costs, which were reduced by 200 billion won through employee furloughs.

#### Employee Furloughs and Government Support
- Korean Air implemented sequential paid furloughs for employees, reducing labor costs significantly.
- The company received government employment retention subsidies, covering a portion of basic salaries.
- However, this strategy has raised concerns about employee welfare, as furloughs impact immediate livelihoods, especially for crew members with low base salaries.
- Government support is limited to six months per year, raising concerns about potential unpaid furloughs or layoffs once the support ends.

#### Conclusion and Future Considerations
- While Korean Air's profitability is noteworthy, it highlights the need for sustainable strategies that balance company survival with employee welfare.
- There is a call for solutions that ensure the well-being of employees while maintaining the company's financial health.
