   - Korean Air (대한항공) is confirmed to be pursuing the acquisition of Asiana Airlines.
   - The acquisition is seen as a potential solution to the issues faced by both companies.

2. **Challenges in the Acquisition:**
   - **Financial Hurdles:**
     - As of June, Asiana Airlines has a debt exceeding 12 trillion won.
     - There are concerns about whether Korean Air, which is also facing financial difficulties, can secure the necessary funds for the acquisition.
     - Asiana Airlines has decided on a 3-to-1 stock reduction and is involved in a lawsuit to use a 250 billion won deposit from a previous merger attempt with HDC Hyundai Development Company to alleviate financial burdens.

   - **Monopoly Concerns:**
     - Post-acquisition, Korean Air's market share in passenger and cargo routes, especially to the Americas, is expected to exceed 75%.
     - This raises potential antitrust issues, with the Fair Trade Commission possibly not approving the merger due to monopoly concerns.
     - However, given the current crisis, there is speculation that exceptions might be made.

3. **Stakeholder Positions:**
   - The Korea Development Bank, Asiana Airlines' main creditor, is considering various options, including the acquisition by Korean Air, but no decision has been finalized.
