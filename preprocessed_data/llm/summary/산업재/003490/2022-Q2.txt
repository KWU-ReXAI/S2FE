**Summary of the Video Transcript:**

1. **Incident Overview:**
   - A Korean Air (대한항공) passenger plane experienced an emergency landing in Azerbaijan after departing from Istanbul for Incheon. The emergency was due to vibrations and flames detected from the engine approximately 1.5 hours into the flight.

2. **Engine Details:**
   - The engine in question is the Pw-4170, manufactured by Pratt & Whitney. Korean Air has 11 aircraft equipped with this engine model.

3. **Investigation Findings:**
   - Initial investigations suggest a defect in the engine's design and manufacturing. The issue was traced to the duct, a pathway for air, where a component detached and struck the low-pressure turbine, causing a fire.
   - The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport was informed by Korean Air about the potential engine defect. It was noted that uneven coating on the duct might have led to the detachment of parts.

4. **Current Status and Recommendations:**
   - Korean Air reported no abnormalities in their internal inspections but acknowledged the need for ongoing, periodic investigations.
   - There is a focus on design and manufacturing flaws rather than maintenance issues.

5. **Related Incidents and Manufacturer's Response:**
   - A similar engine model by Pratt & Whitney had previously failed during operation in the U.S., leading to a suspension of similar engines in Korea.
   - Pratt & Whitney stated that the current incident is unrelated to the previous one and that it is too early to determine the exact cause. The investigation is expected to take over a year to conclude.

This summary captures the key points regarding the engine defect incident involving Korean Air, the investigation's findings, and the broader context of similar past incidents.
