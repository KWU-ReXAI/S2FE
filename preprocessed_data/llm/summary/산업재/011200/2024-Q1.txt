### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:

1. **Overview of HMM and Shipping Industry:**
   - HMM is a key player in the shipping industry, sensitive to the Shanghai Container Freight Index.
   - Recent trends show an increase in shipping indices, contributing to HMM's stock price momentum.

2. **Financial Performance:**
   - HMM's revenue and operating profit are projected to increase in 2023 and 2024.
   - This growth is expected to lead to an increase in EPS (Earnings Per Share) and BPS (Book Value Per Share), indicating strong financial health.

3. **Stock Valuation:**
   - HMM's current stock price is lower than its BPS, suggesting it is undervalued and attractive from a fundamental analysis perspective.

4. **Impact of Global Events on Shipping Indices:**
   - The Shanghai Container Freight Index and Baltic Dry Index are rising due to global economic recovery, particularly in China.
   - China's economic recovery is marked by increased demand for iron ore and positive trade balance, despite some indicators being below expectations.

5. **Geopolitical Risks:**
   - Ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as conflicts involving Iran and Israel, could lead to further increases in shipping indices due to potential disruptions in key shipping routes like the Hormuz Strait.

6. **Oil Prices and Shipping Costs:**
   - Recent increases in oil prices, driven by reduced U.S. oil inventories and geopolitical tensions, typically negatively impact shipping stocks due to higher costs.
   - However, the current trend shows that shipping stocks like HMM are still gaining momentum despite rising oil prices, as shipping costs have a more direct impact on stock performance.

7. **Future Outlook:**
   - For HMM's stock to continue rising, the Shanghai Container Freight Index needs to remain strong, supported by China's economic recovery and potential interest rate cuts.
   - Geopolitical risks, particularly related to the upcoming U.S. elections, could further influence shipping indices and HMM's stock performance.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - HMM's stock is currently in a strong upward momentum due to favorable shipping indices and geopolitical factors.
