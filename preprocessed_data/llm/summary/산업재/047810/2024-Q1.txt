**Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:**

1. **Indonesia's Payment Proposal:**
   - Indonesia proposed to pay only one-third of its share in a joint defense project, requesting the rest to be covered through technology transfer.
   - The Korean government is considering this proposal, despite concerns about Indonesia's commitment and reliability.

2. **Economic and Strategic Considerations:**
   - Excluding Indonesia from the project is possible but deemed economically disadvantageous by the Korean defense authorities.
   - The potential financial loss from excluding Indonesia outweighs the benefits, as it would mean forfeiting additional payments.

3. **Challenges in International Defense Collaboration:**
   - The existing contract with Indonesia is for the development of the KF-20 Block 1, which complicates the inclusion of new partners at this stage.
   - Future collaborations for subsequent projects or new-generation fighter jets are possible.

4. **Cost Management and Savings:**
   - Korea has managed to save significant costs (approximately 5,000 billion won) in the KF-21 project through efficient management and process improvements by KAI (Korea Aerospace Industries).
   - This cost-saving effort is crucial in offsetting the financial burden due to Indonesia's reduced payment.

5. **Weaknesses in Korea's Defense Export Strategy:**
   - Korea's defense export strategy lacks robust financial packages and mechanisms to recover payments, which is a competitive disadvantage.
   - The need for legislative and strategic improvements in defense sales and financing is highlighted.

6. **International Perception and Future Directions:**
   - The international community is aware of the challenges in Korea's joint development projects, but also recognizes Korea's efficient project management.
   - Future collaborations should consider the specific needs and characteristics of partner countries, such as Saudi Arabia and UAE, to ensure successful joint ventures.

7. **Lessons and Recommendations:**
   - The situation with Indonesia underscores the importance of understanding partner countries' economic and political contexts.
   - Korea should enhance its capabilities in negotiating and managing international defense collaborations, focusing on strategic partnerships with countries that have compatible technological and economic strengths.

8. **Ongoing Investigations:**
   - There are ongoing investigations into potential technology leaks involving Indonesian personnel, which complicates the situation further.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The discussion emphasizes the need for Korea to adopt a more sophisticated approach in international defense collaborations, focusing on strategic, economic, and legislative improvements to maximize benefits and minimize risks.
