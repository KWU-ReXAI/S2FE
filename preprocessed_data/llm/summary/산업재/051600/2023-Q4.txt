1. **Mismanagement of Travel Expenses at 한전KDN:**
   - 한전KDN, a subsidiary of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), was found to have been improperly paying travel allowances since 2016. Employees received 30,000 KRW per day even when staying at their own homes during business trips.
   - An audit revealed that over the past five years, 214 employees, including executives, received a total of 180 million KRW in such allowances.
   - 김장현, the current president, was noted to have claimed 444,000 KRW for 148 days of such allowances, which he returned following the audit's findings.

2. **Bid Rigging and Illegal Subcontracting:**
   - An executive, referred to as A, was involved in bid rigging for a 9.7 billion KRW project by using a partner company as a decoy.
   - A separate 8.3 billion KRW project was subcontracted to a company lacking the necessary capabilities, under the pretext of their difficult circumstances.

3. **Improper Leave Practices at 한전KPS:**
   - 한전KPS, another KEPCO subsidiary, was found to have been granting special paid leave improperly.
   - Employees were given paid special leave for using company condos and for attending training at company facilities in Gyeongju, Naju, and Jeju, which was recorded as training days.
   - Over three years, this practice resulted in over 10,000 days of free leave for employees.

4. **Audit Recommendations:**
   - The audit recommended disciplinary action against the A executive at 한전KDN and called for changes in travel expense regulations.
   - For 한전KPS, the audit suggested eliminating special paid leave and requiring employees to use personal leave days.
