**Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Issues:**

1. **Misuse of Travel Expenses:**
   - Korea Electric Power Corporation's subsidiary, KEPCO KDN, was found to have been paying travel allowances to employees even when they stayed at their own homes during business trips.
   - This practice has been in place since 2016, with 214 employees receiving a total of 180 million KRW over the past five years.
   - The current president, Kim Jang-hyun, was also involved, having claimed 4.44 million KRW for 148 nights, which he returned after being pointed out by the audit.

2. **Bid Rigging and Illegal Subcontracting:**
   - An executive, referred to as Manager A, was involved in bid rigging for a 9.7 billion KRW project by using a partner company as a decoy.
   - Additionally, an 8.3 billion KRW project was subcontracted to a company lacking the necessary capabilities, under the pretext of their difficult circumstances.

3. **Improper Leave Practices:**
   - Another KEPCO subsidiary, KEPCO KPS, was found to have been granting special paid leave improperly.
   - Employees were given paid leave for using company condos or attending training at company facilities, which was recorded as work-related.
   - Over three years, this practice resulted in over 10,000 days of free leave for employees.

4. **Audit Recommendations:**
