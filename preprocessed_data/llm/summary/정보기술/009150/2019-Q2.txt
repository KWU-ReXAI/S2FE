  - **Current Situation**: The stock price has recently fallen from a range of 90,000 to 100,000 KRW, breaking below 90,000 KRW and reaching the low 80,000s. The decline seems to have stabilized around 84,000 KRW.
  - **Investment Advice**: 
    - **No Need for Immediate Action**: The current market downturn does not necessitate selling the stock. The holding is not at a loss that requires a stop-loss action.
    - **Potential for Additional Investment**: Given the formation of a support level, there is potential for additional buying.
  - **Price Targets**: 
    - **Short-term Target**: The target price is set between 95,000 and 96,000 KRW, considering the concentration of trading volume around 95,000 KRW.
    - **Long-term Outlook**: The stock is unlikely to exceed 100,000 KRW this year due to challenges in recovering MLC prices. A more significant price increase is expected in the next year, potentially reaching 115,000 to 120,000 KRW by the first half of the year.
