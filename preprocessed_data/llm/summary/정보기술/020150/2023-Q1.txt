### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:

- **Company Overview**: The discussion centers around Lotte Energy Materials, particularly in the context of its involvement in the electric vehicle (EV) sector and secondary battery materials.

- **Recent Developments**: 
  - Lotte Energy Materials recently announced a long-term supply contract for secondary battery copper foil, which initially led to a stock price increase but was followed by a decline.
  - The contract is valued at approximately 700 billion KRW annually over ten years, totaling 7 trillion KRW. However, this is considered minor compared to the company's annual revenue exceeding 1 trillion KRW.

- **Market Position and Competitiveness**:
  - The company faces challenges due to lower entry barriers in its sector, unlike more competitive areas like cathode materials, which are dominated by high-nickel technology.
  - Other companies in the secondary battery sector, particularly those dealing with cathode materials, are seen as having a competitive edge.

- **Stock Valuation and Investment Strategy**:
  - Lotte Energy Materials' stock is currently undervalued, with its price near the beginning of the year levels.
  - The stock's Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) for 2025 is projected at 15, which is not considered cheap compared to competitors like LNF, which has a lower PER.
  - Despite recent underperformance, the stock is expected to grow in the medium to long term, with a potential target price of 7 million KRW in the short term and 8 million KRW in the long term.

- **Investment Recommendations**:
  - Investors are advised to hold their positions and consider additional purchases if the stock price drops to around 6 million KRW.
  - The recommendation is to aim for a short-term target price of 7 million KRW, with the potential for long-term growth up to 8 million KRW.

- **Conclusion**:
  - The company is expected to be evaluated based on its actual performance rather than speculative contracts.
  - Investors should not be overly concerned with short-term price fluctuations and consider the stock's long-term growth potential.
