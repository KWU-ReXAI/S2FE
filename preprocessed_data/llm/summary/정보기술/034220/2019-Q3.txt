   - The company reported a revenue of 5.8217 trillion KRW and an operating loss of 436.7 billion KRW in the third quarter. The cumulative loss for the year amounts to 937.5 billion KRW.

4. **Implications:**
   - The restructuring efforts, including workforce reduction, are seen as necessary steps for LG디스플레이 to navigate through its financial challenges and improve its market position amidst competitive pressures.
