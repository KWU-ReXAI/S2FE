**Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:**

1. **Conflict Overview:**
   - The ongoing legal and economic conflict between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation over battery technology and trade secrets is intensifying.
   - The dispute has reached a critical point as President Biden's potential veto on an International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling approaches.

2. **Investment Plans:**
   - LG Energy Solution announced plans to invest over 5 trillion KRW in the U.S. by 2025 to build two battery plants, despite not having secured sites yet.
   - This announcement has provoked a strong reaction from SK Innovation, as it could impact their existing battery plant in Georgia.

3. **Legal and Trade Implications:**
   - The ITC has recognized LG's claims of trade secret infringement by SK, potentially leading to a 10-year import ban on SK's batteries, which would severely impact their Georgia plant.
   - SK Innovation is lobbying for President Biden to veto the ITC's decision, citing the importance of their investment and job creation in Georgia.

4. **Arguments from Both Sides:**
   - SK Innovation criticizes LG's actions as irresponsible and argues that blocking the veto would harm U.S. interests.
   - LG maintains that SK should compensate for the trade secret infringement and emphasizes the importance of fair competition.

5. **Broader Industry Context:**
   - The conflict is set against the backdrop of global competition in the electric vehicle (EV) market, with companies like Volkswagen partnering with Chinese firms like CATL.
   - There is a call for domestic companies to collaborate to maintain market share globally.

6. **Upcoming Developments:**
   - A preliminary decision on a separate battery patent infringement case filed by LG against SK is expected soon, which could further influence the situation.
