**Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:**

1. **Current Market Situation:**
   - The semiconductor stocks have reached their short-term peak, and despite the index rising to 2450, these stocks have not been able to lead the market.
   - The speaker notes that although the index has increased compared to three months ago, the prices of semiconductor stocks are declining, indicating the end of a market rally.

2. **Future Market Predictions:**
   - The speaker suggests that stock prices tend to anticipate economic conditions. If the economy impacts semiconductor equipment stocks or prices next year, the stock index will likely drop first, followed by individual stock prices.
   - The speaker anticipates that next year, discussions will revolve around reduced operating profits, which will explain the current price drops.

3. **Specific Stock Analysis - Hanmi Semiconductor:**
   - The stock is currently facing resistance at 8,500 KRW, with a consistent pattern of price rejection at this level.
   - The stock has been defending the 7,700 KRW level for two consecutive weeks, but if it falls below 7,500 KRW, there is a potential for a further 15% decline.
