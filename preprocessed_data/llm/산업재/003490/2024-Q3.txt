   - The merger between Korean Air and Asiana Airlines is nearing completion, with the European Commission expected to give final approval soon.
   - Korean Air has met the conditional approval requirements set by the European Commission, and final approval is anticipated within the month.
   - Post-approval, if the U.S. Department of Justice does not file an antitrust lawsuit, Korean Air plans to acquire new shares of Asiana Airlines by December 20, integrating it as a subsidiary.

2. **Impact of the Merger:**
   - The merger is expected to create a mega airline with approximately 227 aircraft, ranking it among the top 12 global airlines based on cargo transport performance.
   - This consolidation reflects a trend in the global aviation market where only large airlines are surviving, potentially enhancing competitiveness.

   - The merger could expand consumer choices by increasing new destinations and adjusting overlapping flight schedules.

4. **Challenges and Considerations:**
   - The merger process faces several challenges, including:
     - **Organizational Integration:** Complete integration of the two airlines is expected to take an additional two years.
     - **Workforce Management:** Although Korean Air states there will be no forced restructuring, managing redundant staff and minimizing internal resistance is crucial.
     - **Route Adjustments:** Adjustments made to routes to gain merger approval leave the issue of handling surplus staff as a pending task.
     - **Mileage Program Integration:** The integration of Korean Air and Asiana Airlines' mileage programs is expected to be contentious, with potential consumer dissatisfaction over the conversion ratios.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While the merger holds promise for creating a more competitive and expansive airline, it must navigate significant logistical and consumer-related challenges to achieve a smooth transition.
