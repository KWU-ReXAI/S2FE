### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments

1. **Concept of "선반영" (Pre-reflection):**
   - The term "선반영" refers to the phenomenon where stock prices do not rise despite positive news or earnings surprises because the market has already anticipated and reflected these expectations in the stock price.
   - Example: HMM's stock price surged 12 times over a year before the first-quarter results were announced, reflecting market expectations of record-high performance and container freight index.

2. **Market Expectations and Investment:**
   - Understanding market expectations is crucial for successful investing. If investors can accurately read and anticipate changes in market expectations, they can achieve superior returns.
   - Michael Mauboussin, a prominent investment strategist, emphasizes the importance of reading current market expectations and predicting when and where these expectations will change.

3. **Michael Mauboussin's Investment Philosophy:**
   - Mauboussin outlines a three-step approach to expectation investing:
     1. Identify the market's expectations reflected in stock prices.
     2. Determine when and where these expectations might change.
     3. Decide on buying or selling based on anticipated changes in expectations.

4. **Case Study: Gateway:**
   - Mauboussin uses Gateway as an example to illustrate his investment philosophy.
   - He suggests using the concept of PIE (Price Implied Expectations) to understand market expectations by working backward from the current stock price to estimate future cash flows and growth rates.
   - Key factors affecting stock prices, such as sales growth rates and operating margins, should be identified and analyzed.

5. **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) and PIE:**
   - DCF is used to calculate a company's current value by discounting future cash flows at a certain rate.
   - PIE reverses this process by setting the current stock price as the target and estimating the growth rates and profit margins needed to justify this price.

6. **Market Assumptions and Investment Decisions:**
   - Investors should focus on the assumptions the market is making about a company's future performance, such as sales growth and operating margins.
   - For example, Gateway's stock price was analyzed based on different sales growth scenarios, leading to varying price targets.

7. **Avoiding Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
   - Mauboussin warns against the sunk cost fallacy, where investors justify past decisions rather than focusing on current value.
   - He advises buying stocks only when they are trading significantly below their expected value, regardless of past decisions.

8. **Practical Application:**
   - Mauboussin's approach provides a structured framework for investment decision-making, allowing investors to use quantitative data to guide their choices.
   - He encourages investors to use available data sources to practice reading market expectations and making informed investment decisions.

### Conclusion
Michael Mauboussin's expectation investing philosophy offers a systematic approach to understanding and leveraging market expectations for successful investing. By focusing on market assumptions and avoiding common investment pitfalls, investors can make more informed and potentially profitable decisions.
