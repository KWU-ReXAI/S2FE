### Summary of Key Economic Ideas and Arguments:

- **Core Revenue Source**: The primary cash cow for POSCO International is the Myanmar gas field project. The company produces and sells gas from Myanmar, primarily to Myanmar and China.

- **Operational Challenges and Recovery**: There was an incident in June of the previous year that halted gas sales to China until November. This year, the company is expected to benefit from a base effect, assuming no further incidents occur, leading to increased sales volumes compared to the previous year.

- **Financial Projections**:
  - **Operating Profit**: Expected to increase by over 17% annually.
  - **Net Profit**: Anticipated to rise by more than 160%.

- **Strategic Expansion**: POSCO International plans to leverage the success of the Myanmar gas project to expand its LNG value chain, including production, sales, and power generation, positioning itself as a global resource development company.

- **Valuation and Investment Appeal**:
  - The current stock price is considered undervalued with a Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PER) of 6.76 and a Price-to-Book Ratio (PBR) of 0.7, which is at the lower end of its historical PBR band.
  - Despite low net profits last year, the company paid a dividend of 600 KRW per share. With expected profit increases, dividends are likely to be higher, offering a dividend yield of 3.4% based on the current stock price.

- **Investment Strategy**:
  - Suggested stop-loss price: 16,900 KRW.
  - Target price: Around 21,000 KRW.
